Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Scheduler package migration** — the canonical scheduler, cron parser, and daemon process moved
  from `src/scheduler/` and `src/processes/scheduler-process.ts` into `packages/infra/src/scheduler/`
  and `packages/infra/src/processes/scheduler-process.ts`, completing the `@cortex/infra` package
  boundary. All 10 consumers (tools, CLI, API routes across `src/` and `packages/`) now import from
  the packages/infra location. Removed duplicate trigger files (`watcher.ts`, `webhook.ts`) from
  `packages/infra/src/triggers/` — the canonical versions remain in `src/triggers/`.
  (`packages/infra/src/scheduler/scheduler.ts`, `packages/infra/src/scheduler/cron.ts`,
  `packages/infra/src/processes/scheduler-process.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `deno.json`,
   all routes/tools/CLI consumers)

### Added

- **Logger env-var overrides** — file transport can now be configured entirely via environment
  variables without touching `config.json`. `CORTEX_LOG_FILE` sets the log file path (and enables
  file logging), `CORTEX_LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES` sets the max file size before rotation, and
  `CORTEX_LOG_FILE_MAX_FILES` sets the rotation count. All three combine with the existing
  `CORTEX_LOG_LEVEL` for a complete env-driven logging setup. (`src/utils/logger.ts`)

- **JSON-structured stdout logging** — set `CORTEX_LOG_JSON=1` (env) or `jsonStdout: true`
  (config.json `logging` block) to emit JSON-line log entries to stdout instead of pretty-printed
  text. Designed for log aggregators (Datadog, Loki, Grafana Cloud, container stdout collectors).
  Each line includes `ts`, `level`, `msg`, `ns`, `reqId`, `data`, and `stack` fields.
  (`src/utils/logger.ts`)

- **`resetLogger()` utility** — clears all logger state (level, transports, request ID) for test
  isolation. Tests can now `resetLogger()` then `configureLogger()` with a clean slate without
  leaking state between test cases. (`src/utils/logger.ts`)

- **Logger unit tests** — 23 tests covering the full public API: level gating (trace through
  silent), namespace hierarchy via `.child()`, request ID propagation, error stack traces, env-var
  overrides, JSON stdout mode, transport broadcasting, concurrent emit safety, and realistic
  production scenarios (agent loop turn logging, server request lifecycle). (`tests/logger_test.ts`)

- **Metrics unit tests** — 17 tests for the Prometheus metrics module: counter increment
  accumulation across labels, gauge set replacement, histogram value aggregation, `renderPrometheus`
  output validation (HELP/TYPE header correctness, label tuple formatting, `_sum`/`_count` suffix),
  `resetMetrics` clearing all state, custom metric registration, and production scenarios simulating
  agent turn metrics and node swarm directives. (`tests/metrics_test.ts`)

- **Eval framework tests** — 32 tests for the scoring and regression detection logic: `regex:`,
  `contains:`, `not_contains:`, and fuzzy pattern matching with edge cases (empty output, unicode,
  emoji, multi-line code blocks, special regex characters), `scoreFileContent` with and without
  `shouldContain`, `checkRegression` with threshold boundaries (including floating-point tolerance),
  and realistic agent output scenarios (code generation, bug fixes with partial failures, TypeScript
  file checks). (`tests/eval_framework_test.ts`)

- **Trigger persistence** — triggers (webhooks, file watchers, git hooks) were previously stored
  only in an in-memory `Map` and lost on server restart. A new `triggers` DB table (migration 048)
  stores the full trigger configuration as JSON. `registerTrigger()` and `unregisterTrigger()` now
  persist to the database, and `initTriggers()` loads persisted triggers at server startup. The
  enable/disable route also persists the enabled state. (`packages/infra/src/triggers/db.ts`,
  `src/triggers/manager.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`, `src/server/routes/triggers.ts`,
  migration `048_triggers_persistence.sql`)

- **Scheduled agent-task support** — the job scheduler can now dispatch agent turns on a cron
  schedule in addition to shell commands. Jobs with `action_kind: 'agent_turn'` and an
  `action_config` containing `{prompt, agent_id}` are executed by the scheduler daemon via
  `createTriggerJobCreator()`, creating an ephemeral agent session and dispatching a fire-and-forget
  agent turn. The schedule tool gained `agent_prompt` and `agent_id` parameters, and
  `POST /api/jobs` accepts `actionKind` and `actionConfig` fields. (`packages/infra/src/scheduler/
  scheduler.ts`, `packages/infra/src/processes/scheduler-process.ts`,
  `src/tools/builtin/schedule.ts`, `src/server/routes/jobs-crud.ts`)

- **Job description field** — `CreateJobOptions` and the jobs DB table INSERT/UPDATE now accept an
  optional `description` field. `POST /api/jobs` forwards it, and the schedule tool's `formatJob()`
  displays it in listings. (`packages/infra/src/scheduler/scheduler.ts`,
  `src/server/routes/jobs-crud.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/schedule.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Job API input validation** — `POST /api/jobs` now validates that `name` is present, a string,
  non-empty, and ≤200 characters; `command` is required for shell jobs. Returns clean 400 errors
  instead of silently creating broken jobs. (`src/server/routes/jobs-crud.ts`)

## [0.53.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **Instance admin assignment bug** — `createUser()` with `isAdmin: true` was overwriting all
  existing administrators with a singleton array, destroying prior admin assignments. Now reads
  the existing admins list and appends the new user. (`src/server/auth.ts`)

- **Session persistence gap** — sessions were stored only in an in-memory `Map`, lost on server
  restart. Sessions now also persist to the `sessions` DB table via `createSession()`, and new
  functions `listUserSessions()` / `destroyAllUserSessions()` enable per-user session management.
  (`src/server/auth.ts`)

- **Multi-user password change** — `changePassword()` previously only handled legacy vault-stored
  passwords. New `changeUserPassword()` verifies the user's individual PBKDF2 hash and updates
  it. `adminResetUserPassword()` lets instance admins reset any user's password. The
  `/api/auth/change-password` route now detects authenticated multi-user sessions and uses the
  correct handler. (`src/server/auth.ts`, `src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`)

- **Duplicate password-change route removed** — `src/server/routes/password-change.ts` was a
  duplicate of the `/api/auth/change-password` handler in `public-auth.ts` and lacked session
  checks. Deleted and removed from `src/server/new-router.ts`.

- **Federation pairing token security** — pairing tokens were stored without expiry and never
  validated. Tokens now carry a 1-hour TTL (stored as JSON `{token, expiresAt, used}` in the
  `config` table), are validated during pair, and are single-use with a `used` flag. Replay and
  expired tokens are rejected with 401. (`src/server/routes/federation.ts`)

- **Federation agent discovery** — `GET /api/federation/peers/:id/agents` was a hardcoded stub
  returning `"Remote agent discovery pending"`. Now fetches the remote peer's `.well-known/
  agent-card.json` with fallback to the A2A transport protocol. (`src/server/routes/federation.ts`)

- **Team DELETE cascade** — deleting a team only removed `team_memberships` rows, leaving orphaned
  references in `agents`, `sessions`, `services`, `nodes`, `channels`, and `workspace_config`.
  Now clears `team_id` to NULL on all scoped resources before deleting the team.
  (`src/server/routes/teams.ts`)

- **Input validation on teams routes** — `join_policy` and `role` values are now validated against
  allowed enum values before hitting the DB, returning clean 400 errors instead of cryptic SQL
  constraint failures. (`src/server/routes/teams.ts`)

- **`requireResourceOwner` guard coverage** — only handled 5 resource types (agents, sessions,
  services, nodes, channels). Added support for `workspace_config`, `triggers`, `workflows`,
  `projects`, and `glossary`. (`src/server/guards.ts`)

- **Remove dead `mcp-gateway-cmd.ts` CLI file** — deprecated command orphan that was not
  registered in the CLI command tree. The gateway functionality moved to `cortex mcp gateway`.
  (`src/cli/mcp-gateway-cmd.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/mcp-gateway-cmd.ts`)

- **Sync migrations to `@cortex/core` package** — migrations 044–047 (users/teams, vault scoping,
  memory scoping, core scoping) existed in `src/db/migrations/` but were missing from
  `packages/core/src/db/migrations/`, causing a pack sync gap for consumers of `@cortex/core`.
  (`packages/core/src/db/migrations/044_users_teams.sql` through `047_core_scoping.sql`)

- **Split `eval-routes.ts` catch-all** — 831-line monolithic route file holding 7 different
  API areas (memori, eval, cost optimizer, observability, benchmarks, PKM, glossary, promptlab,
  memory benchmark) was split into dedicated route files. Prompts routes moved to
  `src/server/routes/promptlab.ts`, PKM routes to `src/server/routes/pkm.ts`, glossary routes to
  `src/server/routes/glossary-routes.ts`. All three registered in `src/server/new-router.ts`.

### Added

- **User lifecycle management endpoints** — `GET /api/users/:id`, `PATCH /api/users/:id` (update
  display_name/email), `DELETE /api/users/:id` (cascades: tokens, memberships, shares, admin
  list). `POST /api/users/:id/reset-password` for admin-initiated password resets.
  (`src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`, `src/server/auth.ts`)

- **Self-service user profile** — `GET /api/auth/profile` and `PATCH /api/auth/profile` let
  authenticated users view and update their display_name and email without admin intervention.
  `updateUserProfile()` function added to auth layer. (`src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`,
  `src/server/auth.ts`)

- **Session management API** — `GET /api/auth/sessions` lists all active sessions for the
  current user. `DELETE /api/auth/sessions/:id` revokes a specific session. `DELETE
  /api/auth/sessions` revokes all other sessions (keeps current). (`src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`,
  `src/server/auth.ts`)

- **Federation instance identity** — `GET /api/federation/identity` returns the instance's ECDSA
  P-256 public key and instance name, auto-generating the key pair on first access. `POST
  /api/federation/identity/rotate` rotates the key pair. `GET /api/federation/status` returns
  peer count, instance identity, and connected swarm nodes. Federation pairing now performs
  mutual public key exchange. (`src/server/routes/federation.ts`)

- **Federation peer management** — `GET /api/federation/peers/:id` fetches a single peer.
  `POST /api/federation/peers/:id/ping` tests connectivity to a peer with a 5-second timeout.
  Paired peers register with the swarm coordinator for resource tracking.
  (`src/server/routes/federation.ts`)

- **Team join endpoint** — `POST /api/teams/:id/join` allows self-service enrollment into
  open teams. Respects join policy: open teams auto-enroll as member, invite teams reject with
  "invitation needed", closed teams reject. (`src/server/routes/teams.ts`)

- **User-level team listing** — `GET /api/users/:id/teams` returns all teams a user belongs to
  with their role and join date. Accessible to the user themselves or instance admins.
  (`src/server/routes/teams.ts`)

- **Team member detail** — `GET /api/teams/:id/members/:userId` fetches a single member's details
  including display_name, email, role, and join date. (`src/server/routes/teams.ts`)

- **Resource share detail + update** — `GET /api/shares/:id` fetches a single share (accessible
  to sender, recipient, or admin). `PATCH /api/shares/:id` allows the sender to change the
  permission level (read/write/admin). (`src/server/routes/shares.ts`)

- **Team management UI** — Teams page now includes a Create Team form (name, description, join
  policy dropdown), Add Member form with user search dropdown and role selector, Toggle Role
  and Remove Member buttons per member, a Delete Team button with confirmation, and a Back
  button from detail view. Team cards display member count and join policy labels.
  (`src/server/ui/js/27_teams.ts`)

- **User management UI enhancements** — Users page now includes email field and Instance Admin
  checkbox in the create user form, an ADMIN badge on admin users, a Reset Password button
  with inline form, and a Delete User button with confirmation. Admin list is fetched from the
  config API. (`src/server/ui/js/28_users.ts`)

## [0.53.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Multi-user collaboration** — users, teams, API tokens, and resource scoping across the entire
  platform. New `users` table with PBKDF2 password hashing, `teams` table with join policies,
  `team_memberships` join table with admin/member roles, `user_tokens` table for API access
  (SHA-256 hashed), `agents` DB table for agent storage (moved from `config.json`), `resource_shares`
  table for cross-user sharing, `instance_identity` and `federation_peers` tables for instance-to-instance
  federation. (`packages/core/src/db/migrations/044_users_teams.sql` through `047_core_scoping.sql`,
  `src/server/auth.ts`)
- **Database migrations 044–047** — identity tables (users, teams, memberships, tokens, agents,
  federation, resource_shares), vault scoping columns (`owner_user_id`, `owner_team_id`), memory
  scoping columns on all memory tables, and resource scoping columns on services/nodes/channels/
  workspace_config. Auto-admin creation on first run with backfill of existing resource rows.
  (`src/db/migrate.ts`)
- **Agent storage moved from `config.json` to `agents` DB table** — full DB-based CRUD with
  user/team/instance scope filtering. Config.json agents preserved as fallback for backward
  compatibility during transition. Built-in agents seeded into DB as instance-scoped.
  (`src/db/agents.ts`, `src/agent/manager.ts`, `src/agent/builtin-agents.ts`)
- **Request identity system** — `RequestIdentity` interface (`user`/`instance`/`anonymous`) with
  userId, teamIds, currentTeamId, isInstanceAdmin fields. Extracted from session cookies or
  `Authorization: Bearer` API tokens via `extractIdentity()`. (`src/server/identity.ts`,
  `src/server/auth.ts`)
- **Authorization guards** — `requireInstanceAdmin()`, `requireTeamAdmin()`, `requireTeamMember()`,
  `requireResourceOwner()` functions for coarse permission checks. Authorization enforced on
  agent detail endpoints (GET/PUT/DELETE) and agent creation with team membership validation.
  (`src/server/guards.ts`, `src/server/routes/agents.ts`)
- **API token management** — `POST /api/auth/tokens` to create tokens, `GET /api/auth/tokens` to
  list, `DELETE /api/auth/tokens/:id` to revoke. Tokens support team-scoping via `team_ids` JSON
  column, expiration dates, and last-used tracking. (`src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`)
- **Team management API** — `GET/POST /api/teams`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/teams/:id`,
  `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/teams/:id/members`, `GET/POST /api/teams/:id/agents`.
  Team-scoped agent creation with membership validation. (`src/server/routes/teams.ts`)
- **Resource sharing API** — `POST /api/shares` to share resources between users,
  `GET /api/shares/given` and `GET /api/shares/received` to list shares,
  `DELETE /api/shares/:id` to revoke. Ownership validation enforced before sharing.
  (`src/server/routes/shares.ts`)
- **Federation API** — `POST /api/federation/generate-pairing-token`, `POST /api/federation/pair`,
  `GET /api/federation/peers`, `DELETE /api/federation/peers/:id` for instance-to-instance
  trust establishment. (`src/server/routes/federation.ts`)
- **User management API** — `GET/POST /api/users`, `POST /api/users/:id/disable` and
  `POST /api/users/:id/enable` (instance admin only). (`src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`)
- **Multi-user web UI** — login page with username+password fields (`src/server/ui-auth.ts`),
  team selector dropdown in header (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`), Teams page with member management,
  Users page with create/disable/enable (instance admin). (`src/server/ui/js/27_teams.ts`,
  `src/server/ui/js/28_users.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/login.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/teams.ts`)
- **CLI commands for multi-user** — `cortex login` (username+password or API token),
  `cortex logout`, `cortex whoami`, `cortex users list/create/disable/enable`,
  `cortex teams list/create`. Auth token stored in `~/.cortex/auth.json`.
  (`src/cli/user-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/registry.ts`)
- **Locale translations** — all 10 non-English locale files (ar, de, es, fr, hi, ja, ko, pt, ru, zh)
  fully translated from English source. Preserves `{variable}` placeholders, Unicode symbols, CLI
  commands, and JSON structure. (`locales/*.json`)

### Changed

- **Login flow** — `/api/auth/login` now accepts `{ username, password }` for multi-user
  authentication. Falls back to legacy vault-based password verification when username is omitted
  (`src/server/routes/public-auth.ts`)
- **Session model** — `Session` interface gained `userId` and `username` fields. Sessions
  are still in-memory (7-day expiry) but track the authenticated user for downstream scoping.
  (`src/server/auth.ts`)
- **Auth middleware** — `requireAuth()` now extracts `RequestIdentity` with user/team/admin context
  and returns it alongside the authenticate flag. `authGuard` stores identity in a `WeakMap` for
  downstream route handlers. (`src/server/auth.ts`, `src/server/routes/auth-guard.ts`)
- **Agent CRUD scoped** — `listAgents()` accepts optional `userId` and `teamIds` for three-layer
  filtering (user → team → instance). Agent routes pass identity context for scope-aware
  operations. (`src/agent/manager.ts`, `src/server/routes/agents.ts`)
- **Settings page** — Removed "Web Authentication" section (password setup/change, require-auth
  toggle) now that user management is handled through the Users page. (`src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Migration version collision** — four-part migration 044 (identity, vault, memory, core scoping)
  now uses unique version numbers 044–047 to prevent skip of subsequent migrations after the first
  sub-migration is applied. (`src/db/migrate.ts`)
- **Team agent listing** — `listAgents()` now correctly returns team-scoped agents when called with
  `teamIds` but without `userId`. (`src/db/agents.ts`)
- **Agent authorization** — GET/PUT/DELETE on individual agents now validates the authenticated user
  owns or has team access to the agent, preventing unauthorized access to private agents.
  (`src/server/routes/agents.ts`)
- **Agent creation scoping** — `POST /api/agents` now validates team membership before accepting
  a `teamId` parameter, preventing agent injection into arbitrary teams.
  (`src/server/routes/agents.ts`)
- **Per-user default agent isolation** — `selectAgent()` no longer overwrites the global
  `defaultAgent` when a user selects a personal default. (`src/agent/manager.ts`)
- **Share ownership validation** — `POST /api/shares` now verifies the sender owns the resource
  before creating the share. (`src/server/routes/shares.ts`)
- **Federation pairing token** — `POST /api/federation/generate-pairing-token` now returns the
  actual stored token instead of a mismatched new UUID. (`src/server/routes/federation.ts`)
- **Auth per-request DB query** — `requireAuth()` now caches the user-existence check using a
  module-level flag with invalidation on user create/disable/enable, eliminating a `COUNT(*)`
  query on every API request. (`src/server/auth.ts`)
- **Teams/Users page rendering** — fixed incorrect DOM target (`main-panel` → `teams-content` /
  `users-content`) and wrong escape function (`escHtml` → `esc`) in teams and users page JS.
  (`src/server/ui/js/27_teams.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/28_users.ts`)

### Removed

- **`src/server/precedence.ts`** — dead file with no consumers (29 lines). Resource precedence
  resolution will be re-added when needed by callers.
- **`getAgentsForConfigFallback()`** — unused export from `src/db/agents.ts`.
- **`getUserScopeFilter()`** — unused export from `src/server/guards.ts`.
- **`extractIdentity` import** — removed dead import from `src/server/routes/auth-guard.ts`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Glossary REST API** — `GET/POST /api/glossary`, `GET /api/glossary/:term`, `GET /api/glossary/categories` endpoints for term definition, lookup, listing, and category browsing. (`src/server/routes/glossary.ts`, `src/server/new-router.ts`)
- **AgentLint CLI agent-id support** — `cortex agent lint check <agent-id>` now accepts an optional agent ID for per-agent linting. (`packages/cli/src/cli/agentlint-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/agentlint-cmd.ts`)
- **/soul TUI slash command** — added `/soul` to TUI completions for showing agent soul/prompt context. (`packages/cli/src/tui/completions.ts`, `src/tui/completions.ts`)
- **Tool toggle/stats endpoints** — `POST /api/tools/:name/toggle` and `GET /api/tools/:name/stats` route handlers for enabling/disabling tools and querying usage stats. (`src/server/routes/tools-list.ts`)
- **MCP Gateway approval workflow** — `createApproval()`, `approveGatewayRequest()`, `denyGatewayRequest()`, `getPendingGatewayApprovals()` functions with `POST /api/mcp-gateway/approvals`, `/:id/approve`, `/:id/deny`, `GET /api/mcp-gateway/approvals` REST endpoints. (`packages/server/src/mcp-gateway/gateway.ts`, `src/server/routes/mcp-connections.ts`)

### Changed

- **Documentation overhaul** — updated all version references from 0.51.0 to 0.53.0 across root
  docs (AGENTS.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md), wiki pages (Home, AGENTS, Sidebar,
  Architecture, CLI-Reference, Configuration, Distributed-Nodes, Security, Plugin-System, Changelog,
  LLM-Providers, Agent-Loop, Built-in-Agents), and active docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENT_OS_ALIGNMENT).
  Created 5 new wiki pages (Swarm, Multi-User-Collaboration, API-Tokens, Federation, Login-&-Auth).
  Updated provider count 24→30, route modules 62→69, UI modules 74→78, migrations 42→47, and DB
  migration paths to reflect the packages/core/ source layout.

### Fixed

- **Wiki accuracy sweep** — fixed 40+ documentation discrepancies across 16 wiki pages: corrected
  Configuration.md defaults (maxTurns, modelSelection, logging, webAuth, supervisor), Home.md
  feature counts (9 channel adapters, 11 sub-agent types, 21 DLP scanners), CLI-Reference.md slash
  commands, Security-Supervisor.md classification default, Code-Sandbox.md Docker images and output
  limits, Code-Intelligence.md language count, AgentLint.md check count (29), Database-Migrations.md
  migration count (47) and file paths, Channel-Adapter-API.md shared modules and table name,
  Model-Routing/Quartermaster.md provider counts, Sub-Agents.md tool lists, Built-in-Tools.md
  missing file_diff tool, A2A-Protocol.md task states and CLI commands, Architecture.md stale
  pre-modularization paths, and REST-API.md phantom endpoints (36 marked as planned/🔜).

### Removed

### Security

## [0.52.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **WASM plugin ABI versioning** — new `plugin_get_abi_version()` export and `host_get_abi_version()` host
  function allow forward/backward compatible plugin loading. Host rejects WASM modules with unsupported
  ABI versions. Current ABI version: 1. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM linear memory allocator** — replaced hardcoded offset magic numbers with a bump allocator
  (`host_alloc`/`host_free` host functions). Memory layout: 64KB host scratch → 64KB allocator metadata
  → 896KB managed heap → WASM static data. Bounds-checked with auto-grow. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM synchronous HTTP** — `host_http_request` now blocks synchronously via a dedicated `Worker`
  thread + `SharedArrayBuffer` + `Atomics.wait`. 30-second timeout, proper status/body return. Replaces
  the previous broken fire-and-forget `fetch().then()` pattern. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`,
  `src/plugins/wasm-worker-http.ts`)
- **WASM tool parameter schemas** — capabilities JSON now supports full `params[]` with `name`,
  `type` (`string`|`number`|`boolean`|`object`|`array`), `description`, and `required`. LLMs can now
  understand WASM tool signatures. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM PluginContext integration** — `loadWasmPlugin()` now accepts `PluginContext`, giving WASM
  plugins access to logging (`host_log`), state persistence (`host_set_state`/`host_get_state` via
  SQLite-backed in-memory cache with dirty tracking), and configuration (`host_get_config` via
  `CORTEX_PLUGIN_{NAME}_{KEY}` env vars). (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM permission enforcement** — `host_http_request` gates on `network:fetch` or `net:outbound`
  capability. Returns 403 if permission not declared. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM execution timeouts** — 120-second maximum per tool execution (`MAX_TOOL_EXECUTION_MS`).
  (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM supply-chain binary scanning** — `scanWasmBinary()` parses WASM section headers to detect:
  suspicious imports (`wasi_snapshot_preview1.proc_exit`, `args_get`, `environ_get`, `sock_*`),
  excessive memory requests (>4GB), unknown `env` imports, and WASM version mismatches. Called
  automatically during plugin installation. (`src/plugins/supply-chain.ts`)
- **WASM diagnostics API** — `getWasmDiagnostics(name)` returns memory usage, heap pointer position,
  ABI version, and tool count for debugging loaded WASM plugins. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM plugin SDK** — C-compatible header (`src/plugins/sdk/wasm-plugin.h`) declaring all host
  functions, memory layout constants, and required exports. TypeScript client library
  (`src/plugins/sdk/client.ts`) with `defineTool()`, `definePlugin()`, `generateCapabilitiesJson()`,
  and `generateWasmPluginModule()` helpers.
- **WASM plugin test suite** — 7 tests covering binary encoding, module compilation, ABI version
  checking, supply-chain scanning, memory layout, capabilities JSON parsing, and worker code
  integrity. (`tests/wasm_plugin_test.ts`)
- **Plugin files now have a single source of truth** — `packages/core/src/plugins/` files replaced
  with re-exports to `src/plugins/`, eliminating 3900+ lines of stale duplicate code.

### Fixed

- **WASM `http_request` was broken** — the host function launched `fetch().then(...)` but returned
  immediately. The WASM module read garbage from memory because the response hadn't arrived. Now
  synchronous via `Atomics.wait`. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM memory layout corruption** — hardcoded offsets (tool name at 1024, args at random positions,
  64KB output at arbitrary offset) could collide with WASM stack/heap data. Replaced with bounded
  scratch area and proper allocation. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM `plugin_destroy` never called** — unload/reload leaked `WebAssembly.Memory` and instance.
  `destroyWasmPlugin()` now called from `unloadPlugin()` in the loader. Cleans up memory cache too.
  (`src/plugins/loader.ts`, `src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM state lost on restart** — `_wasmState` was an in-memory `Map<string, string>`. Now
  per-plugin cache + dirty-tracking flush to SQLite via `PluginContext.state`.
  (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM plugins had no PluginContext** — `loadWasmPlugin(row)` didn't accept `ctx`, so WASM plugins
  couldn't log, persist state, or access config. `ctx` parameter is now optional (backward compatible).
  (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`, `src/plugins/loader.ts`)

### Changed

- **WASM host function names** — renamed with `host_` prefix for clarity and to avoid conflicts with
  WASM module internals: `log` → `host_log`, `get_config` → `host_get_config`, `set_state` →
  `host_set_state`, `get_state` → `host_get_state`, `http_request` → `host_http_request`. New
  functions: `host_alloc`, `host_free`, `host_get_abi_version`, `host_get_time_ms`, `host_random`.
  (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **WASM `get_config` priority** — now checks `CORTEX_PLUGIN_{NAME}_{KEY}` first (PluginContext-aware),
  falling back to `CORTEX_WASM_{KEY}`. (`src/plugins/wasm-runtime.ts`)
- **Supply-chain verifier** — non-WASM files still get text-based malware pattern scanning; WASM
  binaries get dedicated binary analysis. (`src/plugins/supply-chain.ts`)
- **Telegram webhook method named `handleWebhookUpdate`, not `handleWebhook`** — the webhook route
  dispatches to `channel.plugin.handleWebhook()`, but Telegram's method was `handleWebhookUpdate`.
  Added `handleWebhook(data)` that delegates to `handleWebhookUpdate`. (`src/channels/telegram.ts`)
- **Channel bridge missing tool registration and `toolContext`** — `createChannelEventHandler()`
  called `agentTurn()` without `registry`, `toolContext`, workspace directory, system prompt, or
  plugin loading. The agent would have had zero tools available. Added `registerAllBuiltins`,
  `pluginManager.loadAll()`, `loadAgentIdentity` + `buildSystemPrompt`, workspace dir creation, and
  full `toolContext` with `workingDir`/`agentId`/`workspaceDir`/`model`/`provider`. Also now sends
  error responses back to the channel when `agentTurn()` throws. (`src/channels/bridge.ts`)
  kernel process trees and resource accounting across machines using the A2A protocol as the wire
  transport. Cortex instances can now form a swarm: register as nodes, discover peers, dispatch
  directives, and aggregate resource usage across the entire fleet.
  - **Swarm contracts** (`packages/infra/contracts/swarm.ts`) — `ISwarmNode`,
    `ISwarmCoordinator`, `ISwarmTransport`, plus types for directives, resource reports, node
    registration payloads, and runtime metrics (`NodeMetrics`).
  - **Node registry** (`packages/infra/src/swarm/node-registry.ts`) — CRUD over the existing
    `nodes` table (migration 015); periodic heartbeat with metrics snapshots into new
    `swarm_resource_snapshots` table; stale-node eviction; peer discovery via A2A agent cards,
    config seed nodes, or shared DB fallback.
  - **A2A-based transport** (`packages/infra/src/swarm/transport.ts`) — maps swarm directives to
    A2A `SendMessage` JSON-RPC calls; agent card caching; `Promise.allSettled` broadcast fan-out.
  - **Swarm coordinator** (`packages/infra/src/swarm/coordinator.ts`) — `swarm` singleton:
    self-registration, peer discovery, directive dispatch (tracked in new `swarm_directives`
    table), broadcast to node groups, aggregated resource reporting, 30s heartbeat loop with
    CPU/memory/token metrics, drain/seal lifecycle.
  - **Directive handler** (`packages/infra/src/swarm/directive-handler.ts`) — receiving side: processes
    all 5 directive kinds (`spawn_agent`, `execute_task`, `query_resources`, `forward_message`,
    `sync_state`) on the target node.
  - **Remote kernel** (`packages/infra/src/swarm/remote-kernel.ts`) — proxy remote processes into the
    local `OsKernel` process tree (synthetic PIDs ≥900000); aggregated resource accounting across
    all connected nodes.
  - **A2A server integration** (`packages/server/src/a2a/server.ts`) — `registerSwarmHandler()` and
    `SwarmDirectiveHandler` interface; `handleSendMessage` detects `metadata.swarmKind` and routes
    swarm directives to the directive handler instead of the normal Cortex executor.
  - **Migration 043** (`src/db/migrations/043_swarm.sql`) — `swarm_directives` and
    `swarm_resource_snapshots` tables plus metrics/labels/a2a_endpoint columns on `nodes`.
  - **CLI** (`src/cli/swarm-cmd.ts`) — `cortex swarm` command with `init`, `nodes`, `topology`,
    `report`, `drain`, and `seal` subcommands.
  - **Config** (`src/config/config.ts`) — `SwarmConfig` interface with `seedNodes`, `group`, and
    `enabled` fields under `config.swarm`.
  - **Web UI — Nodes page** (`src/server/ui/pages/nodes.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/15_nodes.ts`) —
    new swarm fleet summary cards (CPU avg, memory, sessions, processes, tokens today) computed
    from per-node heartbeat metrics; enhanced node cards with CPU/memory color-coded bars, active
    session/process counts, A2A endpoint, and key=value labels; view-mode toggle between Node
    List, Swarm Topology (process tree + fleet token/cost report), and Directive History table.
  - **Swarm API routes** (`src/server/routes/swarm.ts`) — `GET /api/swarm/topology`,
    `GET /api/swarm/report`, `GET /api/swarm/directives`, `GET /api/swarm/nodes/metrics`,
    `GET /api/swarm/nodes/:id/snapshots`; registered in `new-router.ts` under protected routes.
  - **Nodes API enrichment** (`src/server/routes/nodes.ts`) — `GET /api/nodes` now includes swarm
    fields (`cpu_percent`, `memory_used_mb`, `memory_total_mb`, `active_sessions`,
    `active_processes`, `a2a_endpoint`, `labels`) alongside existing hub node data.

- **DeepInfra provider** — OpenAI-compatible provider for `api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai`.
  Default model: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`. Supports all standard parameters plus
  repetition penalty. Includes pricing for 6 popular models. (`packages/ai/src/llm/deepinfra.ts`,
  `src/llm/deepinfra.ts`)

- **Hyperbolic provider** — OpenAI-compatible provider for `api.hyperbolic.xyz/v1`. Default
  model: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3`. 80% cheaper than traditional cloud providers. Includes
  pricing for 4 models. (`packages/ai/src/llm/hyperbolic.ts`, `src/llm/hyperbolic.ts`)

- **MiniMax provider** — OpenAI-compatible provider for `api.minimax.chat/v1`. Ships the MiniMax
  M3 model (80.5% SWE-bench Verified at $0.30/$1.20 per 1M tokens), the cheapest 80%+ coding
  model available through a hosted API. Includes pricing for 4 models.
  (`packages/ai/src/llm/minimax.ts`, `src/llm/minimax.ts`)

- **Zhipu (GLM) provider** — OpenAI-compatible provider for `open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`.
  Default model: `glm-4-flash` (free tier). Includes pricing for 5 models.
  (`packages/ai/src/llm/zhipu.ts`, `src/llm/zhipu.ts`)

- **Replicate provider** — custom REST API provider for `api.replicate.com/v1`. Uses the
  predictions-based API with polling for non-streaming completions and SSE streaming for
  streaming mode. Includes pricing for 4 popular open-source models.
  (`packages/ai/src/llm/replicate.ts`, `src/llm/replicate.ts`)

- **Cloudflare Workers AI provider** — custom REST API provider for Cloudflare's edge
  inference platform (`api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run`). Requires
  both API token and Account ID. Supports SSE streaming. Includes pricing for 4 models.
  `accountId` field added to `IProviderConfig` and `ProviderConfig`; flow plumbed through
  config save route, model fetch route, UI provider modal (extra field), and router factory.
  (`packages/ai/src/llm/cloudflare.ts`, `src/llm/cloudflare.ts`,
  `packages/core/contracts/config.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`,
  `src/server/routes/config-routes.ts`, `src/server/routes/providers.ts`,
  `src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Migration 043 placed in wrong directory** — `043_swarm.sql` was created in
  `packages/core/src/db/migrations/` but `migrate.ts` reads from `src/db/migrations/`, causing
  `server start` to crash with `NotFound: No such file or directory`. Copied to
  `src/db/migrations/043_swarm.sql`.

- **Novita models endpoint returned 404** — the model fetcher used
  `api.novita.ai/openai/v1/models` but the provider's base URL is `api.novita.ai/v3/openai`.
  Fixed to `api.novita.ai/v3/openai/models` to match the provider's API version.
  (`src/server/models.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/models.ts`)

- **Alibaba models fetcher used wrong regional domain** — used `dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`
  (international endpoint) while the Alibaba provider uses `dashscope.aliyuncs.com` (China
  mainland). Unified to the China endpoint to match the provider. (`src/server/models.ts`,
  `packages/server/src/server/models.ts`)

- **`fetchModelsForModal` required API key for localhost providers** — the model fetch button
  in the Add/Edit Provider modal required an API key for all providers except Ollama. LM Studio
  and LiteLLM (localhost providers) were also blocked. Added `lmstudio` and `litellm` to the
  bypass list. (`src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`,
  `packages/server/src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`)

- **LM Studio dead `numCtx`/`keepAlive` configuration fields** — the UI showed context window
  and keep-alive fields for LM Studio in the provider modal, but LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible
  chat API doesn't support these as request parameters (they're server-side model-loading
  settings). Removed from `PROVIDER_EXTRA_FIELDS` to avoid misleading users.
  (`src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`)

- **Cloudflare model fetch had no access to Account ID** — the providers route
  (`/api/providers/{kind}/models`) only passed `baseUrl` to model fetchers, but Cloudflare
  needs the Account ID. Added special-case routing: when `kind === 'cloudflare'`, passes
  `stored.accountId` instead of `stored.baseUrl` as the second argument. Also added
  `accountId` to the config save route handler body interface.
  (`src/server/routes/providers.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/routes/providers.ts`,
  `src/server/routes/config-routes.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/routes/config-routes.ts`)

- **Codegraph: call edges attributed to wrong source node** — `extractCalls()` was setting `sourceQName: ''` for every call, causing all edges in a file to point to the first indexed node via `fileNodeMap` fallback. Now tracks parent function/method context through the AST walk and emits `${filePath}:${containingFunction}` sourceQName, matching the node qualified-name format. (`src/codegraph/indexer.ts`)

- **Codegraph: edge sourceQName absolute↔relative path mismatch** — edge sourceQNames carried absolute paths while node qualified-names used relative paths from `indexFile` normalisation, causing `resolveEdges` to miss valid source nodes. Now transforms absolute `filePath` to `relPath` in edge sourceQNames during `indexFile`. (`src/codegraph/sync.ts`)

- **Codegraph: `bulkInsertNodes` returned wrong IDs causing edge FK violations** — used `BEGIN`/`INSERT`/`SELECT last_insert_rowid()`/`COMMIT` across separate `db.run()` calls. The libSQL client may use different connections per call, so `last_insert_rowid()` returned stale/zero values and computed IDs drifted from actual DB rowids by 2+. Replaced with single `db.insert()` call that captures `lastInsertRowid` from the same execute result. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`)

- **Codegraph: post-insert DELETE removed all edges** — after each chunk's edge INSERT, a cleanup `DELETE … WHERE source_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM code_nodes …)` ran. Due to connection state issues the subquery returned empty and deleted all edges including freshly inserted ones. Removed; the pre-insert `validEdges` filter already guarantees referential integrity. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`)

- **Codegraph: auto-index infinite loop + data corruption** — the architecture endpoint re-triggered auto-index on every page load when `node_count === 0`. A failed prior auto-index left `node_count` stuck at 0 (nodes persisted but edges failed), causing each subsequent load to delete-and-retry, corrupting data indefinitely. Now only auto-indexes when the project truly does not exist; if `node_count` is stale but actual nodes are present, fixes the counter without re-indexing; on index failure clears `p` to return "Project not found" instead of serving corrupted state. (`src/server/routes/codegraph.ts`)

- **Codegraph: stale projects from deleted workspaces persisted** — `deleteProject()` in `projects/manager.ts` only removed the filesystem directory; codegraph data in memory.db was never cleaned up. Added `deleteCodeProject()` that deletes the `code_projects` row (child tables cascade via `ON DELETE CASCADE` FK). The project list endpoint now cross-references with workspace directories, excludes stale entries, and fire-and-forget cleans them from the DB. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`, `src/server/routes/codegraph.ts`)

- **GitHub clone missing token authentication** — `POST /api/projects/import-github` called `git clone` with `repo.html_url` (bare `https://github.com/owner/name`) without embedding the GitHub token, so private repos and rate-limited public access failed. Now constructs `https://{token}@github.com/{fullName}.git` and passes it to `git clone`. (`src/server/routes/projects.ts`)

- **`decryptValue()` returned encrypted `enc:` string on failure** — the config decryption helper caught errors but returned the raw `enc:…` ciphertext instead of `null`. Since the encrypted string is truthy, the `?? null` fallback never triggered, and corrupted encrypted blobs flowed through `loadConfig()` into the vault migration code. Now returns `null` on decryption failure. Added belt-and-suspenders `startsWith('enc:')` guards in `getGitHubToken()` and `loadGitHubToken()` to skip any value that survived. (`src/config/config.ts`, `src/workspace/github.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`)

- **Six CLI aliases silently `Deno.exit(1)` instead of delegating** — `cortex chat`, `tui`, `serve`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` were registered as top-level wrapper commands that printed a deprecation warning and exited with code 1, preventing any actual work. The real implementations in `chat.ts`, `tui-cmd.ts`, `serve.ts`, `start.ts`, and `stop.ts` were fully functional but unreachable through these aliases. Removed the dead alias stubs from `src/main.ts`; users now reach the canonical paths (`cortex agent chat`, `cortex agent tui`, `cortex server start`, `cortex daemon start|stop|restart`) directly.

- **Six fully-implemented CLI commands never registered** — `cortex run`, `cortex update`, `cortex migrate`, `cortex service`, `cortex qm`, and `cortex mqm` had complete implementations (10–293 lines each) but were missing from the active command registry in `src/cli/registry.ts`. Three were in the stale `packages/cli/src/cli/registry.ts` (never imported); three were registered nowhere. All six now registered in the active registry. (`src/cli/registry.ts`)

- **`PUT /api/workflows/:id` parsed update body but never applied mutations** — the handler deserialised `body.name` and `body.description`, validated the workflow exists, then returned `{ ok: true }` without modifying anything. Now applies `description` and `name` updates directly on the `Workflow` instance; renames atomically (delete old name, register under new name) and returns a 409 if the target name is already taken. (`src/server/routes/workflows.ts`)

- **Pipeline stages `pre-reflect` and `post-reflect` defined but never wired** — both were listed in the `PipelineStage` union type but had zero `runHooksForStage()` calls anywhere in the agent loop. The reflection logic in `src/agent/post/background.ts` ran `reflectOnTurn()` and `adversarialReflection()` directly, bypassing the hook system. Now wraps reflection with `pre-reflect` and `post-reflect` hook invocations, building an `AgentState` from the runtime `TurnContext` and passing reflection results (standard + adversarial JSON) into the `post-reflect` stage. (`src/agent/post/background.ts`)

- **Stale `packages/cli/src/cli/registry.ts` removed** — the file was byte-for-byte identical to the active `src/cli/registry.ts` at one point but had drifted (missing 2 entries, held 3 stale entries), and was never imported by anything. Deleted.

- **`AGENTS.md` contained wrong migration paths and count** — claimed migrations live at `packages/core/src/db/migrations/`, registration at `packages/core/src/db/migrate.ts`, and "currently 41 migrations." Corrected to `src/db/migrations/`, `src/db/migrate.ts`, and 42 respectively.

- **Three test files used legacy `deno.land/std@0.203.0/testing/asserts.ts` imports** — `tests/phase2_endpoints_test.ts`, `tests/phase2_endpoints_all_test.ts`, and `tests/phase2_pages_metadata_test.ts` imported from the old Deno CDN URL instead of the project-consistent `@std/assert` import map entry. Updated to `import { assertEquals } from '@std/assert'`.

- **Phase2 dev-mode endpoints now annotated with `TODO(phase2)`** — the three `/api/phase2/` endpoint handlers returned hardcoded placeholder `<div>` strings; now carry explicit `TODO(phase2)` comments describing the planned real analytics/config/state/stats data. (`src/server/routes/health.ts`)

### Changed

- **`ProviderKind` consolidated to single source of truth** — the 24-provider union type was defined identically in three places: `packages/core/contracts/config.ts` (contract layer), `src/config/config.ts` (implementation), and `packages/core/src/config/config.ts` (package implementation). Both implementation files now `import type { ProviderKind }` from the contracts file and re-export it. Adding a new provider now requires changes in only the contracts file. (`src/config/config.ts`, `packages/core/src/config/config.ts`)

- **`packages/server/src/server/server.ts` replaced with canonical re-export** — the 321-line packages copy was missing 98 lines of startup logic (install manifest detection, vault availability check, pre-start sanity checks, auto-tunnel, auto-channels, vault guard in UI auth) compared to the canonical `src/server/server.ts`. Since zero files import the packages copy, replaced the entire file with a 1-line `export { startServer, type ServeOptions }` re-export of the canonical version.

- **Sandbox contracts documented as aspirational** — `ISandboxProvider` and `ISandboxBackend` in `packages/gate/contracts/sandbox.ts` had zero implementations (the active executor uses direct functions). Added a header doc comment noting these are aspirational design contracts for a future multi-backend sandbox system (Docker / subprocess / gVisor / E2B / Daytona).

- **Removed unused `@std/datetime` and bare `@std/encoding` from `deno.json` import map** — `@std/datetime` had zero imports across all 1000+ `.ts` files. The bare `@std/encoding` entry was never used; all actual encoding imports go through `@std/encoding/base64`. Both removed. (`deno.json`)

## [0.51.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Checkpoint Time-Travel UI** — the Memori page (`/memori`) now renders a full two-panel timeline: a session-grouped checkpoint list on the left and a rich detail view on the right. Each checkpoint shows turn number, goals, message count, tool calls, and workspace snapshot. Two action buttons — **Resume here** (restore the checkpoint into the current session) and **Branch from here** (fork into a new child session) — are available on every checkpoint. Helper functions `fmtTokens`, `fmtTimeAgo`, and `memoriStat` power the compact summary cards. (`src/server/ui/pages/memori.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/22_mcp_memori.ts`)

- **Runtime Tool Forging** — agents can now create, test, and export custom tools at runtime via three new built-in tools:
  - `tool_forge` — takes `name`, `description`, and TypeScript `code`; runs a static safety scan against `UNSAFE_PATTERNS`; optionally calls an LLM security judge; executes pure-compute code in a Deno Worker (no net/read/write permissions) or shell-touching code in the existing Docker sandbox; registers the result in a session-scoped forged-tool registry.
  - `forged_call` — invokes a previously forged tool by name with arbitrary arguments.
  - `tool_export` — promotes a forged tool to the persistent skills system (lifecycle: `candidate`) so it survives across sessions.
  - `tool_list_forged` — lists all forged tools registered in the current session.
  (`src/tools/builtin/tool_forge.ts`, `src/tools/registry.ts`)

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration — `orchestrate` tool with 6 strategies** — a single `orchestrate` tool now exposes six composable multi-agent execution strategies, all backed by `spawnSubAgent`:
  - `sequential` — chains agents; each receives the previous agent's output as context.
  - `parallel` — runs agents concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`; a synthesiser agent merges outputs.
  - `debate` — N agents argue assigned positions for R rounds; an impartial judge synthesises the final answer.
  - `review-loop` — a writer agent drafts, a reviewer agent critiques, iterating up to `max_iterations` times until the reviewer emits an approval keyword.
  - `hierarchical` — a coordinator agent decomposes the task, worker agents execute sub-tasks in parallel, the coordinator synthesises results.
  - `graph` — user-defined DAG of `{id, task, dependsOn[]}` nodes; topological execution with dependency context injection.
  (`src/agent/orchestration/strategies.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/orchestrate.ts`, `src/tools/registry.ts`)

- **HEXACO Personality System** — agents can now be configured with a six-factor HEXACO personality (`h`, `e`, `x`, `a`, `c`, `o` ∈ [0, 1]). The personality drives:
  - **System prompt injection** — `buildPersonalityPrompt()` generates a natural-language paragraph describing the agent's voice, honesty, emotional tone, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, prepended to the system prompt on every turn.
  - **Memory retrieval bias** — `getMemoryBiasWeights()` returns per-tier multipliers (episodic, semantic, procedural, preference) and BM25/vector balance weights derived from personality scores.
  - **Response style hints** — `buildResponseStyleHints()` produces brief post-processing nudges (structured output, warmth, perspective acknowledgement, creative alternatives).
  - **MQM routing hints** — `getMqmPersonalityHints()` returns `accuracyWeight`, `creativityWeight`, and `preferFast` signals for the Model Quartermaster.
  The `personality` field is optional on `AgentConfig`; absent or neutral scores (0.5) produce no change in behaviour.
  (`src/agent/personality.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`, `src/agent/types.ts`, `src/agent/stages/prompt-builder.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`)

- **Memory Benchmark Runner — LongMemEval-S compatible** — a new benchmarking subsystem evaluates the agent's memory recall against a question-answer suite:
  - `src/eval/memory-bench.ts` — core runner with configurable concurrency, token-overlap + Jaccard scoring, per-category aggregation, and JSON persistence to `~/.cortex/data/memory_bench_results.json` and `memory_bench_history.json`.
  - `cortex eval memory` CLI command — supports `--suite <file>`, `--sample <n>`, `--full`, and `--json` flags. (`src/cli/eval-memory-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/registry.ts`)
  - REST API — `GET /api/eval/memory/results`, `GET /api/eval/memory/history`, `POST /api/eval/memory/run`. (`src/server/routes/eval-routes.ts`)
  - Web UI — new **Memory Benchmark** page (`page-eval-memory`) with summary stat cards, per-category accuracy bar chart, per-question result table, and historical run trend table. One-click **▶ Run Benchmark** button triggers a live run via the API. (`src/server/ui/pages/eval-memory.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/26_eval_memory.ts`, `src/server/ui/mod.ts`)
  - CI workflow — `.github/workflows/memory-bench.yml` runs the benchmark weekly (Monday 06:00 UTC) and on manual dispatch; results are uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact and summarised in the job step summary.

- **10 built-in agents (5 new, 5 refined)** — the agent roster now ships with 10 selectable built-in agents. Five new specialist agents join the existing five: **Writer** ✍️ (technical documentation, changelogs, READMEs, API references), **DevOps** 🚀 (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines), **Security** 🔐 (OWASP Top 10 auditing, CVE scanning, compliance review — read-only), **Code Reviewer** 👁️ (structured BLOCKER/SUGGESTION/NITPICK/QUESTION review format — read-only), and **QA / Tester** 🧪 (test generation, coverage analysis, regression discipline). All five existing agents (Assistant, Developer, Researcher, Architect, Analyst) received deep soul rewrites adding Capabilities, Guardrails, and Limitations sections, explicit sub-agent delegation hints, and improved output format specs. (`src/agent/builtin-agents.ts`)

- **Two new sub-agent types** — `reviewer` (Code Reviewer) and `writer` (Technical Writer) added to the sub-agent type system. `reviewer` produces structured review reports with BLOCKER/SUGGESTION/NITPICK/QUESTION labels and a per-finding rationale/suggestion format. `writer` produces audience-appropriate documentation following Keep a Changelog and API doc conventions with accuracy-first constraints. Both are accessible via `sub_agent` tool with their respective type strings. (`src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`)

### Changed

- **Sub-agent prompts refined across all 11 types** — targeted improvements to every existing sub-agent system prompt:
  - `explore`: added explicit scope boundary (stay within task, don't roam)
  - `general`: added scope escalation rule (report unexpected expansion rather than acting unilaterally)
  - `plan`: steps now require explicit IDs (S1, S2, …) for dependency tracking; constraint wording tightened
  - `code`: verification is now mandatory — "run tests; do not skip verification"; fix test failures before reporting done
  - `research`: added source-quality hierarchy (official docs > peer-reviewed > reputable news > blog posts); constraint softened from "no commands" to "no commands unless needed for research"
  - `security`: dependency checklist expanded with dependency confusion, typosquatting, and supply-chain risks; summary format made explicit; severity uncertainty defaults to higher
  - `debug`: git history check promoted to step 1 (before reproduce); regression test added to step 7
  - `architect`: "Extend, don't replace" principle promoted to top-level design principle
  - `devops`: Kubernetes and Terraform capabilities added explicitly; "show commands before running destructive ops" constraint added
  - `data`: explicit causation caveat added; "never hide gaps" added to caveats format
  - `ui`: no prompt change (already well-structured)
  (`src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`)

- **`INIT_SOUL_TEMPLATE` sub-agent type list updated** — the default soul now documents all 13 sub-agent types (added `reviewer` and `writer` entries, updated descriptions for `plan`, `code`, `security`, `debug`, `architect`, and `devops` to reflect refined capabilities). (`src/agent/soul.ts`)

- **Extensions top-nav category** — plugins now have a dedicated **Extensions** top-nav tab (sixth tab in the header). Plugin-contributed panels appear as first-class sub-nav items under Extensions rather than being buried in a Panels tab. Clicking a panel item navigates directly via `showPluginPanel()` with full URL hash deep-link support (`#pluginpanel:<pluginId>:<panelId>`). Page restore on reload handles `pluginpanel:` hashes correctly. (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/05_nav_pre.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/07_nav_post.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/24_deferred.ts`)

- **Plugin sidebar slot injection** — plugins declaring `ui:panel` now have their panels registered in the `ui-slots` registry at load time. A new `GET /api/plugins/slots` endpoint exposes live slot registrations. `loadPluginSidebarSlots()` fetches slots at boot and injects `sidebar`-slot plugins as clickable items above the sidebar footer; clicking opens the plugin HTML in an inline modal iframe. (`src/plugins/loader.ts`, `src/server/routes/plugins.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **Plugin middleware pipeline hooks** — ESM plugins can now export `middlewarePre` and `middlewarePost` functions alongside their capabilities declaration. When loaded, plugins declaring `middleware:pre`/`middleware:post` capabilities have their functions automatically registered as `pre-tool`/`post-tool` pipeline hooks. Hooks are fully unregistered when the plugin is disabled or removed. (`src/plugins/types.ts`, `src/plugins/loader.ts`)

- **Plugin event bus wiring** — the plugin event bus now receives live agent lifecycle events: `agent:turn-start` (after user message is persisted), `tool:pre-execute` (before each tool call), `tool:post-execute` (after each tool result), and `agent:turn-end` (in background after response is complete). All emissions are fire-and-forget and never block the response. (`src/agent/stages/setup.ts`, `src/agent/stages/tool-executor.ts`, `src/agent/post/background.ts`)

### Fixed

- **`host.registerTool` / `host.unregisterTool` were no-ops** — `PluginContext.host` stubs silently discarded tool registrations made from lifecycle hooks. Both methods now delegate to `globalRegistry.register()` / `globalRegistry.unregister()` so plugins can register tools dynamically from `onActivate` and unregister them from `onDeactivate`. (`src/plugins/context.ts`)

- **Plugin panel navigation moved to Extensions category** — `extensions` page removed from `system` category and given its own `extensions` category in `CATEGORY_PAGES`. The old sidebar `Plugin Panels` section (a duplicate nav mechanism) removed from shell HTML. (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/05_nav_pre.ts`)

- **`unloadPlugin` left dangling pipeline hooks and UI slot registrations** — disabling or removing a plugin now calls `unregisterAllForPlugin()` (pipeline hooks) and `unregisterUIPlugin()` (UI slots) in addition to unregistering tools. (`src/plugins/loader.ts`)

### Changed

- **Navigation consolidation — 9 pages merged into 5 tabbed hubs** — eliminated duplicate and fragmented pages by merging related UI into unified tabbed interfaces:
  - **Sandbox** now includes a **Code Runner** tab (previously standalone `coderunner` page), alongside Snapshots, Workspace, Dev Env, and Bug Repro.
  - **Remote & Computer** merges the former `remote` (Remote Agents) and `computer` (Computer Use) pages into a single page with two tabs.
  - **MCP** merges `mcp` (Connections) and `mcp-gateway` (Gateway) into one page with two tabs.
  - **System Health** (formerly Daemons) merges daemon process monitoring and OS health metrics into one page with two tabs.
  - **Automation** expands to a 5-tab hub: Hooks, Triggers, Workflows, Jobs, and Eval — replacing four separate nav entries.
  - **Extensions** gains a **Panels** tab, absorbing the standalone Plugin Panels page.
  - **Activity (Lens)** moved from the Knowledge category to System, where audit/observability tooling belongs.
  - Removed 9 retired page entries from `PAGES`, `CATEGORY_PAGES`, `mod.ts` imports, and command palette. (`src/server/ui/js/05_nav_pre.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/07_nav_post.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/13_command.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/20_extensions.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/22_mcp_memori.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/23_sandbox.ts`, `src/server/ui/mod.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/automation.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/daemons.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/extensions.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/mcp.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/remote.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/sandbox.ts`)

## [0.50.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Secure tunnel UI — Tailscale & Cloudflare Zero Trust** — new dedicated **Tunnels** page (`Settings → Tunnels`) with full lifecycle management: provider selector cards (Tailscale / Cloudflare), per-provider option forms (Funnel vs Serve mode, binary path, named-tunnel credentials), auto-start toggle, live status bar with public URL chip (click-to-copy), diagnostics grid, and real-time output log. Accessible via the System category in the sidebar and via the shortcut card in Settings → Tools & Integrations. (`src/server/ui/pages/tunnel.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/25_tunnel.ts`)

- **Tunnel page wired into navigation** — `tunnel` added to `PAGES` array, `CATEGORY_PAGES.system` (intermediate level), `showPage` loader table, `settingsGroup` highlight map, `tabbed` subnav map, and the Tools sub-navigation bar. (`src/server/ui/js/05_nav_pre.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/07_nav_post.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/08_subnav.ts`, `src/server/ui/mod.ts`)

- **Tunnel step in web onboarding** — new **Step 7/9: Remote Access** inserted between Advanced Features and Telemetry. Users can choose Tailscale Funnel, Cloudflare quick-tunnel, or skip. On continue the config is saved and the tunnel is started immediately; if a public URL is obtained it is shown on the completion screen. `TOTAL_STEPS` updated from 8 to 9. (`src/server/ui-auth.ts`)

### Fixed

- **CLI setup channel credentials discarded** — channel credentials collected during `cortex setup` (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Teams, Mattermost, Rocket.Chat, WhatsApp, Google Chat, Lark) were stored in a local `Map` but never persisted to vault or database. Now saved to vault (`channel:` entries) and `channels` DB table during setup. (`src/cli/setup.ts`)

- **Web onboarding provider test always returned success** — `POST /api/onboarding/provider` hardcoded `connected: true` without testing the provider connection. Now runs an actual `provider.complete("Hi")` test and returns the real connection status. The web UI correctly shows success/failure. (`src/server/routes/onboarding.ts`)

- **Channels never auto-started on server boot** — channel configurations saved during onboarding were never loaded at runtime. Added `initChannelsFromDb()` that reads enabled channels from the `channels` DB table, instantiates the adapter plugin, and calls `startChannel()` during server bootstrap. Channels now auto-start after restart. (`src/server/server.ts`)

- **Missing `CORTEX_VAULT_KEY` silently disabled all authentication** — when the vault encryption key env var was unset, `hasPassword()` returned `false` (any vault error), causing `requireAuth()` to return `authenticated: true` — bypassing all auth. Now: `checkVaultAvailability()` runs at server startup (logs warning), `isVaultUnavailable()` tracked globally, `requireAuth()` returns 503 when vault is unavailable, and UI routes show a clear error message instead of silently granting access. (`src/server/auth.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`)

- **Two parallel channel config systems with no bridge** — web onboarding saved channels to `config.plugins.channels` (plaintext in config.json) while the runtime manager used a separate `channels` DB table with vault-encrypted credentials. Now: `POST /api/onboarding/channels` bridges both systems — saves to config.json AND persists to DB+vault. (`src/server/routes/onboarding.ts`)

- **Server started with zero pre-start sanity checks** — the server bootstrap performed no validation of: config file existence, provider API key configuration, vault key availability, or web password status. Now emits startup warnings for each missing element. Config `loadConfig()` also catches corrupted JSON and file read errors gracefully instead of crashing. (`src/server/server.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`)

- **`printSetupHint()` was dead code** — the function was defined but never imported or called. Removed and replaced with inline console warnings in `buildProvider()` and `getActiveProvider()` that display the setup hint when a provider is not configured. (`src/cli/setup.ts`, `src/llm/router.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`)

- **Web onboarding ignored `onboarding.completed` status** — the onboarding page checked `/api/onboarding/status` but only read `hasPassword`, ignoring the `completed` field. Users with completed onboarding could revisit `/onboarding` and overwrite config. Now: JS init redirects to `/` when `completed` is true, restores last step from progress data, and calls the progress endpoint on each step change. (`src/server/ui-auth.ts`)

- **CLI setup never set a web password** — the CLI setup wizard had no password step. Users who ran `cortex setup` via CLI and later started the web UI had no password protection. Added optional web password step (step 4/7) with complexity validation and retry on mismatch. Credentials stored in vault via `setupPassword()`. (`src/cli/setup.ts`)

- **CLI onboarding lost all progress on Ctrl+C** — `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handlers called `Deno.exit(0)` immediately with no config save. Now saves progress (current step, completed steps) after each major step (provider, personality, password, channels). On restart, prompts user to resume from the last saved step. (`src/cli/setup.ts`)

- **Web onboarding progress endpoint existed but was unused** — `POST /api/onboarding/progress` saved step state but the web UI JS never called it. Now wired into `showStep()` to persist step position, and init reads `currentStep` from status to restore position on page reload. (`src/server/ui-auth.ts`)

- **Web AI personalization was a single hardcoded question** — `POST /api/onboarding/profile/start` returned one fixed question ("What do you do?"). Now uses the configured LLM provider to generate contextual questions, extract structured profile data, and ask intelligent follow-ups. Falls back to hardcoded question if provider is unavailable. Web UI now supports multi-turn LLM conversation. (`src/server/routes/onboarding.ts`)

- **CLI provider test failed with no retry option** — the connection test ran once and the wizard continued regardless of result. Now offers retry prompt on failure, looping until connection succeeds or user declines. (`src/cli/setup.ts`)

- **Serve command description was hardcoded English** — `cortex serve` description was a literal string not using i18n. Now uses `i18n.t('cli.serve.commandDescription')`. (`src/cli/serve.ts`)

- **Install manifest not created on non-update startup** — `install.json` was only created during self-update checks. Added `loadManifest()` call during server bootstrap to auto-detect and persist install type on first server start. (`src/server/server.ts`)

## [0.50.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **`cortex import` CLI command** — full data migration system (openclaw, hermes, zeroclaw, transcripts) was implemented (314 lines) but not registered in the CLI registry. Now accessible via `cortex import <source>`. (`packages/cli/src/cli/registry.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/import-cmd.ts`)

- **`cortex qm` / `cortex mqm` CLI commands** — Quartermaster (tool orchestration learning, 293 lines) and Model Quartermaster (model selection intelligence, 243 lines) were fully implemented but not registered. Now accessible via `cortex qm` and `cortex mqm` with subcommands for patterns, weights, stats, decisions, accuracy, and reset. (`packages/cli/src/cli/registry.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/quartermaster-cmd.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/model-qm-cmd.ts`)

- **`cortex service` CLI command** — full micro-service CRUD (list, show, create, update, delete, start, stop — 186 lines) registered. Previously only `service install`/`uninstall` were accessible. (`packages/cli/src/cli/registry.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/service-cmd.ts`)

- **`file_diff` tool registered** — the 476-line file diff tool (unified diffs, side-by-side, syntax hints) was fully implemented and tested but never registered in the tool registry. Agents can now diff files. (`packages/ai/src/tools/registry.ts`, `packages/ai/src/tools/builtin/workspace/file_diff.ts`)

- **Search cache eviction route** — `clearSearchCache()` was exported but never called. Added `DELETE /api/cache/search` endpoint to flush the web search cache. (`src/server/routes/eval-routes.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail panel** — clicking a graph node now opens a side panel showing full entity information (name, type, description, importance, sensitivity, aliases, metadata), all inbound/outbound relations with strength percentages and relation type breakdowns, and entity ID/creation date. Includes `GET /api/memory/graph/entity` endpoint with `name` and optional `type` query params. Graph nodes and relation rows are clickable to navigate between entities. (`src/memory/graph.ts`, `src/server/routes/memory-graph.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/memory.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`, `src/server/ui/css.ts`)

- **Prompt Lab A/B testing and generation** — major expansion of the prompt engineering workspace: adds A/B test creation with variant comparison (avg score, latency, tokens, winner detection with confidence), prompt generation from structured parameters (role, tone, style, length, constraints, examples), automatic prompt variation generation (5 strategies: restructure, clarity, specificity, format, persona), `{{variable}}` interpolation and extraction, test run recording with score/latency/tokens, template CRUD with delete, and a redesigned three-tab UI (Templates, A/B Tests, Generator). 14 API endpoints replace the original 2: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/prompts`, `GET /api/prompts/:id`, `POST /api/prompts/runs`, `GET/POST /api/prompts/ab-tests`, `GET/PUT /api/prompts/ab-tests/:id`, `POST /api/prompts/generate`, `POST /api/prompts/variations`. Run buffer increased from 100 to 500. (`src/prompt-lab.ts`, `src/server/routes/eval-routes.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/promptlab.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **Prompt Lab UI integrity tests** — three new tests in the UI JS integrity suite: validates all 26 prompt lab functions exist in the generated output, all 18 DOM element IDs are present in the page HTML, and `split(/\\n/)` (the correct template-literal-safe regex pattern for newline splitting) exists in the output. Catches the exact class of escaping bugs where `/\n/` inside a template literal produces a literal newline breaking the regex. (`tests/ui_js_integrity_test.ts`)

- **OpenClaw config import (`cortex import config`)** — new subcommand that converts an OpenClaw `openclaw.json` configuration to Cortex `config.json` settings. Maps providers (apiKey, baseUrl, model), agents (id, description, tools from skills), default provider/model, auto model selection pool from provider model lists, plugin configs (firecrawl, litellm, etc.), web search provider, voice/talk config, server settings, and MCP server entries. Supports `--dry-run` for preview. (`src/cli/import/config/types.ts`, `src/cli/import/config/openclaw.ts`, `src/cli/import-cmd.ts`)

- **Unified `cortex import openclaw` command** — rebuilt from a memory-only export importer into a comprehensive migration entry point. Imports config (providers, agents, model pool), session transcripts (from `agents/<id>/sessions/*.jsonl` and `transcripts/*/*/transcript.jsonl`), session metadata (`sessions.json`), and memory files (MEMORY.md, memory/*.md, SOUL.md, USER.md) in a single command. Supports `--config-only`, `--sessions-only`, `--memory-only`, and `--dry-run` flags. (`src/cli/import-cmd.ts`)

- **Enhanced JSONL transcript parser** — the transcript importer now extracts `tool_calls` and `tool_result` from event metadata, populating the `session_messages.tool_calls` and `session_messages.tool_result` columns. Handles `custom_message` events (extension-injected messages visible to model context) and stores `model_change` events as episodic memories. Adds `importOpenClawSessions()` function that recursively discovers transcripts across both agent session directories and historical transcript directories. (`src/cli/import/jsonl.ts`)

- **Config mapper framework** — extensible `ConfigMapper` type and `PROVIDER_NAME_MAP` (25 providers) enabling new source-system adapters to be plugged in. Each mapper receives the source config and existing Cortex config, returning a partial config object and warnings array. (`src/cli/import/config/types.ts`, `src/cli/import/config/openclaw.ts`)

- **Hermes config import** — new config mapper reads Hermes `config.yaml` (via `@std/yaml`) and maps to Cortex config: `model.default` → default provider/model, `model.provider` / `model.base_url` → provider config, `agent.personalities` → Cortex agents, `agent.max_turns` → agent runtime, `terminal.docker_image` → sandbox, `memory.*` → memory config, `mcp_servers` → MCP server entries. (`src/cli/import/config/hermes.ts`, `deno.json`)

- **Hermes state.db direct reader** — new `importHermesStateDb()` reads Hermes' SQLite `state.db` directly (no export step required). Queries sessions (24+ columns: source, user_id, model, parent_session_id, started_at, end_reason, token counts, costs) and messages (18+ columns: role, content, tool_calls, token_count, finish_reason, timestamp). Creates Cortex sessions with `hermes_<id>` naming and writes fully populated `session_messages`. (`src/cli/import/hermes.ts`)

- **Hermes memory file import** — new `importHermesMemoryFiles()` imports `SOUL.md` (copies to Cortex config dir as agent identity), `MEMORY.md` (parsed into episodic memories by `##` heading sections), `USER.md` (copied as user profile), and the `skills/` directory (recursively copied). (`src/cli/import/hermes.ts`)

- **Enhanced `cortex import hermes` command** — rebuilt from a JSONL-only importer into a comprehensive migration entry point. Supports `--config-only` (config.yaml), `--sessions-only` (auto-detects state.db vs JSONL exports), `--memory-only` (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, USER.md, skills/), and `--dry-run`. Auto-discovers Hermes' config.yaml, state.db, and memory files from the detected directory. (`src/cli/import-cmd.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — horizontal top navigation** — replaced the 33-item flat sidebar with a horizontal top bar (5 categories: Chat, Development, Knowledge, Infrastructure, System) containing logo, 5 nav tabs, command palette trigger, experience level toggle, theme toggle, and WebSocket badge. Clicking a category tab shows its contextual sub-nav in the sidebar. (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`, `src/server/ui/css.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — contextual sidebar sub-nav** — sidebar is now dynamically populated by `renderSubNav()` based on the active top nav category. Category-to-page mapping defines 40 pages across 5 categories, each with icon, label, tooltip, and experience level. Sidebar search (`filterNav()`) now searches within the visible category. (`src/server/ui/js/05_nav_pre.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/07_nav_post.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/13_command.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — experience levels with 3-button segmented control** — `[B] [I] [A]` mode toggle in header filters visible navigation by experience level. Beginner sees 10 core pages, Intermediate sees 29, Advanced sees all 40. Persisted in `localStorage` as `cortex_experience_level`. Navigating to a hidden page via URL hash shows a level gate overlay with upgrade button. Command palette also filters by experience level. (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/00_init.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/01_helpers.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/05_nav_pre.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/07_nav_post.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/13_command.ts`, `src/server/ui/css.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — JS tooltip system** — replaced the CSS-only `[data-tip]::after` pseudo-element hack with a proper JavaScript tooltip implementation. Uses event delegation on `[data-tooltip]` attributes, creates a single reusable `#global-tooltip` element with `role="tooltip"` and `aria-describedby`, supports both mouse (250ms delay, instant hide) and keyboard (focusin/focusout), smart positioning (flip above/below, clamp horizontal), and Escape to dismiss. Deployed on all nav items, mode toggle buttons, and theme toggle. (`src/server/ui/js/01_helpers.ts`, `src/server/ui/css.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — dark/light theme toggle** — adds CSS custom property system with dark theme as default (`:root`) and full light theme overrides (`[data-theme="light"]`). Toggle button in header switches between modes, respects `prefers-color-scheme` media query on first load, persists choice in `localStorage` as `cortex_theme`. (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`, `src/server/ui/css.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/00_init.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/01_helpers.ts`)

### Security

- **Comprehensive security policy audit and hardening** — reviewed all 6 layers of built-in security policies (DB rules, validator, guardrails, DLP, capability tiers, auxiliary modules). Identified and resolved 18 issues across critical, high, medium, and low priority tiers.

- **SSRF protection wired into shell command validation** — the existing SSRF module (`resolveAndCheck()` with private IP/DNS blocking) was never called from the validator. Shell commands containing URLs (e.g., `curl http://169.254.169.254/`) now undergo SSRF checks, blocking cloud metadata endpoints, loopback addresses, and RFC 1918 private IPs. (`packages/gate/src/security/validator.ts`)

- **Session isolation enforced at tool-call boundary** — `isPathAllowed()` from the isolation module was registered but never consulted by the validator. File tool path arguments now checked against registered session boundaries, preventing cross-session file access. (`packages/gate/src/security/validator.ts`)

- **Policy table CHECK constraint widened** — migration 009 only allowed `('tool', 'shell', 'domain', 'capability')` kinds, but the validator also checks `'path'` and `'computer'` kinds which could never be inserted. Migration 042 recreates the table with the full set. (`src/db/migrations/042_policy_review.sql`, `packages/core/src/db/migrations/042_policy_review.sql`)

- **16 new default deny rules seeded** — 5 shell rules (`mkfs`, `/proc/sys/` writes, `iptables`/`ufw`, `crontab -`, `git push`), 7 path rules (`/etc/shadow`, `/root/.ssh/`, `.gnupg/`, `.env`, `id_rsa`, `sshd_config`, `sudoers`), 3 domain rules (AWS/GCP metadata endpoints, loopback), 1 computer action rule (`type`). All use `INSERT OR IGNORE` to avoid overwriting user customizations. (`042_policy_review.sql`)

- **4 existing shell regex patterns hardened** — `rm -rf` now catches `-r -f`, `--recursive --force`, and `-fr` variants; fork bomb pattern matches actual `:(){ :|: & };:` syntax; `dd` catches bare device names (`/dev/sda`); `chmod 777` catches `-R 777` and non-root paths. Updates only apply when the original pattern is unmodified. (`042_policy_review.sql`)

- **12 chrome_* and codegraph tool risk profiles added** — `chrome_execute_js`, `chrome_http_auth`, and `chrome_network_rules` set to `'high'` with confirmation required; `chrome_navigate`, `chrome_create_tab`, `chrome_upload_file`, `chrome_save_page`, `chrome_manage_downloads`, `chrome_fill_form`, and `chrome_type_text` set to `'medium'` with appropriate guardrails; `code_index` and `code_pilot` profiled. Previously all fell through to a blanket `'medium'`. (`packages/gate/src/security/dynamic-grant.ts`)

- **`CORTEX_VAULT_KEY` removed from safe environment variables** — the vault encryption key was listed as accessible from any session, creating a path for agents to exfiltrate the master key. Removed from the safe-var set. (`packages/gate/src/security/isolation.ts`)

- **Guardrail shell injection patterns narrowed** — backtick and `$()` patterns matched empty content and blocked legitimate code examples. Changed to `{1,200}` quantifier requiring 1+ characters and bounded to inline code length. (`packages/gate/src/security/guardrails.ts`)

- **Data classification default relaxed from `'sensitive'` to `'normal'`** — the security-first default classified all non-empty content as sensitive, triggering excessive supervisor LLM calls. Following the defense-in-depth review, only content matching explicit SENSITIVE_PATTERNS or SECRET_PATTERNS is now elevated. (`packages/gate/src/security/classification.ts`)

### Fixed

- **`cortex import` command was not registered** — the `import` command entry existed in `packages/cli/src/cli/registry.ts` but was missing from `src/cli/registry.ts`, the actual registry consumed by `src/main.ts`. Added the entry so `cortex import` is now accessible. (`src/cli/registry.ts`)

- **Import subcommand detection functions were swapped** — `cortex import openclaw` called `detectZeroClawDir()` and `cortex import zeroclaw` called `detectOpenClawDir()`. Fixed in both `src/` and `packages/` trees. (`src/cli/import-cmd.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/import-cmd.ts`)

- **Daemon restart was a no-op** — `POST /api/daemons/*/restart` returned `{ok: true}` without actually restarting anything. Daemon processes now write PID files on spawn (`src/processes/supervisor-process.ts`), and the restart handler reads the PID, sends SIGTERM, and waits up to 15s for the supervisor to auto-restart the process. (`src/server/routes/daemons.ts`, `src/processes/supervisor-process.ts`)

- **Workflow approvals always returned empty** — `GET /api/workflows/approvals` hardcoded `json([])`. Now queries all registered workflows for pending approval state. Added `POST /api/workflows/approvals/:name` route for approve/reject actions. UI updated to use `name` instead of `id` for approval actions. (`src/server/routes/workflows.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **Memori preview returned stub** — `GET /api/memori/preview` always returned `{checkpoints: []}`. Now queries the actual checkpoint store with a limit of 5. (`src/server/routes/eval-routes.ts`)

- **Observability traces and embeddings pipeline endpoints marked 501** — `GET /api/observability/traces` and `GET /api/embeddings/pipeline` returned hardcoded empty data. Now return HTTP 501 Not Implemented to signal these features are pending. (`src/server/routes/eval-routes.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail panel — XSS via inline onclick** — the `esc()` function converts `'` to `&#39;`, which the browser HTML parser decodes back to `'` before evaluating inline `onclick` handlers. Entity names containing single quotes could break out of the JS string context and execute arbitrary code. Fixed by using `escJs()` for values inside JavaScript string contexts. (`src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail — uncaught URIError on malformed name** — `decodeURIComponent(name)` in the `/api/memory/graph/entity` route threw `URIError` on invalid percent-encoding with no try/catch, causing an unhandled rejection. Added try/catch returning HTTP 400. (`src/server/routes/memory-graph.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail — non-unique entity name** — `getEntityDetail()` matched only on `name` with `LIMIT 1`, returning an arbitrary entity when duplicates exist (different types share the same name). Added optional `type` query parameter; frontend now passes `d.type` from graph nodes and `r.entity.type` from relation rows. Query uses `WHERE name = ? AND type = ?` when type is provided. (`src/memory/graph.ts`, `src/server/routes/memory-graph.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail — total counts included deleted peers** — `totalInbound`/`totalOutbound` counted raw DB rows including relations to deleted entities, while the displayed relations list filters them out. Counts now computed from the filtered `relations` array. (`src/memory/graph.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail — unbounded relation queries** — outbound and inbound `SELECT` queries on `graph_relations` had no `LIMIT`, unlike the existing `traverseGraph` which uses `LIMIT 10`. Added `LIMIT 200` to both queries. (`src/memory/graph.ts`)

- **Memory graph entity detail — unbounded IN clause** — peer entity lookup used `WHERE id IN (...)` with no cap on placeholders, risking SQLite's 999-parameter limit for heavily-connected entities. Capped `peerIds` to 900 before constructing the IN clause. (`src/memory/graph.ts`)

- **Prompt Lab AB test onclicks — raw comma after backslash-escaped quote** — inline `onclick` handlers using `\\'` (backslash-escaped quote boundary) followed by bare `,` produced a `SyntaxError: Unexpected string` because `,` is invalid JS outside a string context. Fixed by replacing complex ternary-in-onclick handlers with simple helper functions (`plPauseABTest`, `plResumeABTest`, `plCompleteABTest`) that call `updateABTestStatus` internally, avoiding quote-escaping entirely. (`src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **Prompt Lab generator — `split(/\n/)` produced literal newline in template literal** — the `11_pages.ts` file is a TypeScript template literal export (`export const JS_11_PAGES = \`...\``). Inside it, `\n` is interpreted as a template literal escape producing an actual newline character, breaking the regex literal across lines. Fixed by using `split(/\\n/)` (double-escaped backslash) which produces the correct `split(/\n/)` in the output. (`src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

### Changed

- **Misfiled routes reorganized** — `session-links.ts` contained 6 unrelated route groups (security approvals bulk, settings compressor, codegraph pilot-config, agentlint check, agent preferences, sessions links). Routes moved to their semantically correct files: `security.ts`, `config-routes.ts`, `codegraph.ts`, `agents.ts`, `memory-config.ts`. (`src/server/routes/session-links.ts`, `src/server/routes/security.ts`, `src/server/routes/config-routes.ts`, `src/server/routes/codegraph.ts`, `src/server/routes/agents.ts`, `src/server/routes/memory-config.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — CSS rewrite with brand palette** — complete CSS rewrite (599→1000+ lines) with CortexPrism brand colors (cyan `#06b6d4`, indigo `#6366f1`), spacing scale (`--space-1` through `--space-8`), updated typography (Inter 14px/1.6, JetBrains Mono 13px), and 80+ new component classes for header, top nav, sidebar, mode toggle, tooltips, and level gating. All existing component styles (chat, cards, buttons, CodeMirror, agent panel, dashboard, graph) preserved with refreshed values. (`src/server/ui/css.ts`)

- **UI overhaul — shell restructure** — replaced sidebar-centric flex layout with header+body column layout: `<header>` (48px, containing logo, top nav, controls) above `<div class="app-body">` (sidebar + main flex). Removed all 33 hardcoded nav items from `SIDEBAR_HTML`. Sidebar now houses `#sidebar-subnav` container populated dynamically by JS. (`src/server/ui/shell.ts`)

### Removed

- **Dead `packages/core/src/db/migrate.ts`** — 409-line duplicate of `src/db/migrate.ts` that was never imported (all 13+ consumers resolve to `src/db/migrate.ts`). Contained a broken import (`../security/backfill.ts` resolving to a non-existent path). Removed to prevent confusion and staleness risk. (`packages/core/src/db/migrate.ts`)

- **Orphaned `working_memory` table** — the `working_memory` table in the per-session schema (006_session.sql) had zero runtime references. Removed from the session schema. (`src/db/migrations/006_session.sql`, `packages/core/src/db/migrations/006_session.sql`)

- **Orphaned `channel_sessions` and `channel_messages` tables** — these tables in `cortex.db` had zero runtime references (incomplete channel message persistence feature). Dropped via migration 041. (`src/db/migrations/041_cleanup_orphaned.sql`, `packages/core/src/db/migrations/041_cleanup_orphaned.sql`)

- **Dead `savePartialProfile` import** — `workspace-snapshots.ts` imported `savePartialProfile` from `_helpers.ts` but never called it. Import removed. (`src/server/routes/workspace-snapshots.ts`)

- **Remote Agents deploy modal tier mismatch** — the deploy modal dropdown listed nonexistent tiers `operator` and `observer`. Fixed to use the actual capability tiers: `unprivileged`, `sudo`, `root`. (`src/server/ui/pages/modals.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/ui/pages/modals.ts`)

- **A2A remote agents were dead config** — `createA2AToolWrapper()` was defined and exported but never called by any code path. Remote A2A agents configured under `a2a.remoteAgents` in `config.json` were never registered as tools, making the entire feature a no-op. Added registration at the end of `registerAllBuiltins()` that reads `config.a2a.remoteAgents` and registers each agent as a tool (`a2a_<name>`). Gracefully skips when config or remote agents are absent. (`src/tools/registry.ts`)

- **A2A config contract type was `Record<string, unknown>`** — the `a2a` field in `ICortexConfig` (contracts) used a bare generic object type instead of a typed interface. Added `IA2ARemoteAgentConfig` and `IA2AConfig` interfaces with proper fields (`enabled`, `server`, `remoteAgents`). (`packages/core/contracts/config.ts`)

- **`renderThinkingForRestore` regex escapes broken + TS type annotation in browser JS** — 5 regex patterns in the thinking-tag restoration function used single backslashes (`\s`, `\S`, `\/`) inside the template literal export, which TypeScript consumed as escape sequences. `\/` became `/` in the output, terminating the regex literal early and exposing `(?:think)` as raw JS code, causing `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '?'`. Additionally, `const thinkBlocks: string[] = []` had a TypeScript type annotation (`: string[]`) that is invalid in the browser's JS engine, causing `SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration`. Fixed by double-escaping all regex backslashes and removing the type annotation. Added `new Function(js)` syntax validation to prevent future regressions. (`src/server/ui/js/04_chat_ui.ts`)

- **Node agent TLS fields were dead code** — `NodeAgentOptions` declared `tlsCert` and `tlsKey` fields that were never consumed by `createWebSocket()`. Removed both fields from the interface and destructuring. (`src/remote/agent.ts`)

- **Node `rekey` handler was a no-op** — the Hub-to-Node `rekey` message handler only logged the event. Now stores the rotated token in mutable state and closes the WebSocket to trigger an automatic reconnect using the new credential. (`src/remote/agent.ts`)

- **Node `config_update` handler was a no-op** — the Hub-to-Node `config_update` message logged the allow-list but never applied it. Now stores `toolsAllowList` and `blockedTools` in mutable config overrides that `localPolicyCheck()` checks before tier-based rules. The `config_update` message type and `pushConfigUpdate()` signature updated to carry `blockedTools`. (`src/remote/agent.ts`, `src/remote/types.ts`, `src/hub/ws-node.ts`)

- **Dead `RemoteAgentManager` removed** — `src/remote/manager.ts` (47 lines of pure `Map` wrappers) was not imported by any file in the codebase. Superseded by the persisted `hub/node-registry.ts`. Removed from both `src/remote/` and `packages/server/src/remote/`. (`src/remote/manager.ts`, `packages/server/src/remote/manager.ts`)

- **Unused packages/ duplicates cleaned up** — removed 9 dead duplicate files under `packages/server/src/` and `packages/ai/src/` that existed as migration scaffold but were never imported (all imports resolve to `src/`). Fixed broken references in the dead-but-kept `packages/server/src/server/ui/mod.ts`. (`packages/server/src/remote/types.ts`, `packages/server/src/remote/agent.ts`, `packages/server/src/hub/node-registry.ts`, `packages/server/src/hub/ws-node.ts`, `packages/server/src/hub/capability-tiers.ts`, `packages/server/src/hub/session-routing.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/ui/pages/remote.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/ui/js/19_devtools.ts`, `packages/ai/src/agent/node-context.ts`)

- **Directive cancellation not audited** — `cancelPending()` in the session routing layer deleted the directive map entry without logging a lens event. Now logs `node_directive_cancelled`. Added `node_directive_cancelled` to the `EventType` union. (`src/hub/session-routing.ts`, `src/db/lens.ts`)

- **Computer Use Xvfb start/kill per action** — `executeComputerAction()` created a new `ComputerUseExecutor` (starting Xvfb) for every single tool call, then destroyed it. Every mouse click, keypress, and screenshot incurred ~1s Xvfb startup overhead. Replaced with a module-level singleton executor that persists across tool calls and auto-shuts down after 5 minutes of inactivity. Also eliminated a redundant second `loadConfig()` call. (`src/tools/builtin/computer.ts`, `packages/ai/src/tools/builtin/computer.ts`)

- **Computer Use screenshot API returned full base64 blob per request** — the screenshot gallery API loaded every PNG file (~5MB for 24 screenshots) into memory, base64-encoded them all, and sent them inline in the JSON response. Split into a metadata-only list (`GET /api/computer/screenshots`) plus a per-file endpoint (`GET /api/computer/screenshots/:name`). Thumbnails now lazy-load via `fetch()` + data URIs. Config endpoint expanded from 3 fields to 8 (enabled, runtime, screenshot format/quality, action timeout). (`src/server/routes/computer-use.ts`, `src/server/routes/_helpers.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/19_devtools.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/routes/computer-use.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/routes/_helpers.ts`)

- **Remote agent dead code removed** — removed 7 unused type exports from `src/remote/types.ts` (`RemoteAgentStatus`, `RemoteAgentInfo`, `RemoteAgentConfig`, `RemoteDirective`, `RemoteResult`, `StreamChunk`, `RemoteMessage`) and the dead `runRemoteAgent()` wrapper. Extraneous `ws.onclose` handler removed. (`src/remote/types.ts`, `src/remote/agent.ts`)

- **Dead duplicate computer-use files removed** — 6 files under `packages/server/src/computer-use/` were identical duplicates of `src/computer-use/` with adjusted import paths, never imported by any file. (`packages/server/src/computer-use/`)

- **DuckDuckGo "Related" sidebar content confused the LLM** — the `web_search` tool's `instantAnswers()` function labeled DuckDuckGo's `RelatedTopics` API field simply as `**Related:**`, causing the LLM to interpret algorithmically-suggested Wikipedia sidebar snippets as conversation context. This could trigger a recursive tool-call feedback loop where the LLM chased noise through 12 rounds of search before delivering a confused error. Now labeled `**DuckDuckGo Sidebar (algorithmically suggested — may be unrelated to your query):**` with an explicit ignore instruction. (`src/tools/builtin/web_search.ts`, `packages/ai/src/tools/builtin/web_search.ts`)

- **Recursive self-referential tool calls in LLM stream** — the agent loop had no guard against the LLM generating search queries that recycled text from its own prior responses. Added detection: if any search/fetch tool query matches a >30-char substring of recent assistant output, a `[SYSTEM WARNING]` is injected telling the LLM to reread the user's original message. (`src/agent/stages/llm-stream.ts`, `packages/ai/src/agent/stages/llm-stream.ts`)

- **Confusion spiral detection in agent loop** — added a counter tracking consecutive rounds where all tool calls are search/fetch tools. At 3+ rounds with no user-facing output, a `[SYSTEM WARNING]` interrupts the loop telling the LLM it is chasing tangents and to produce results from already-collected data. (`src/agent/stages/llm-stream.ts`, `packages/ai/src/agent/stages/llm-stream.ts`)

- **`<thinking>` tags rendered inline on page refresh** — during live streaming, `<thinking>...</thinking>` blocks were extracted into a reasoning accordion and stripped from display text. But when messages were restored from the database on page refresh (`restoreSession()`) or session switch (`loadSessionMessages()`), raw thinking tags were passed directly to the markdown parser, causing garbled display. Added `renderThinkingForRestore()` helper that extracts thinking blocks into reasoning accordions from restored messages, mirroring the live streaming behavior. (`src/server/ui/js/04_chat_ui.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/02_chat_setup.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/16_agent_panel.ts`)

- **Template literal newline escaping in UI JS export** — a `'\n\n'` in the `renderThinkingForRestore` function was processed as actual newline characters by the TypeScript template literal export, breaking string literals in the concatenated browser-side JS. Fixed to `'\\n\\n'`. (`src/server/ui/js/04_chat_ui.ts`)

- **Model Quartermaster (MQM) prediction & accuracy system overhaul** — 8 fixes to the 6-signal model selection intelligence:

  - **Reflection signal squeezed out by normalization** — `learn.ts` only reinforced 3 of 6 signals (`historical`, `quality`, `reflection`) on good choices, causing the ignored signals (`cost`, `episodic`, `trajectory`) to shrink toward zero after each normalization pass. Now all 6 signals receive proportional reinforcement/punishment, preserving the full signal portfolio over time.

  - **Accuracy threshold inconsistency** — accuracy trend query used `was_correct >= 0.7` while session state accuracy used raw `correctCount` (updated by a separate reflection path). Added `CORRECTNESS_THRESHOLD = 0.7` constant; `observeModel()` now updates both `was_correct` on decisions and `correctCount` in session state from a single source.

  - **Race condition in observe→active mode transition** — both `incrementSessionObservations()` (store) and `observeModel()` (mod.ts) independently set `mode = 'active'` at the 50-observation threshold, risking duplicate mode-change events. Removed mode-setting from `incrementSessionObservations()`; only `observeModel()` handles the transition.

  - **Normalization inflation for single-signal models** — `fusion.ts` computed `confidence = weightedSum / activeWeightSum`, so a model matching only the `reflection` signal (weight 0.05, score 0.9) got confidence `0.9 * 0.05 / 0.05 = 0.9` — same as a model matching all 6 signals. Added coverage penalty: `confidence *= 0.7 + 0.3 * (signalCount / 6)`. A model with 1/6 signals now gets 0.733× multiplier.

  - **Heuristic model tier detection missed modern models** — `estimateModelCost()` and `estimateModelQuality()` used a 3-tier list (`opus|gpt-4|o1`, `sonnet|gpt-3.5`, `haiku|flash|mini`) dating to early 2025. Expanded to 6 tiers covering `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`, `gemini-2.x`, `nova-*`, `llama-3.x`, `mistral`, `phi`, `o3`, `o4-mini` with per-tier cost and quality baselines.

  - **No recency decay on model statistics** — `mqm_model_stats` accumulated forever with equal weight. Added 2%/day decay (floor 40%) on `historical`, `quality`, and `cost` signal scores based on `last_used` timestamp.

  - **Episodic signal relied on fragile regex extraction** — the episodic signal used `(?:model|using|with)\s+([\w-]+)` regex to extract model names from memory hit text, failing when memory entries didn't match this exact pattern. Replaced with direct substring search: scans each memory hit for candidate model name and provider strings.

  - **Cost signal compared per-call, not per-task** — raw `avg_cost_usd` was compared across models without normalizing for task size, penalizing models used for complex tasks. Cost is now divided by `taskComplexity` to produce a cost-per-complexity-unit metric for fair cross-model comparison.

  (`src/model-quartermaster/signals.ts`, `src/model-quartermaster/fusion.ts`, `src/model-quartermaster/learn.ts`, `src/model-quartermaster/mod.ts`, `src/model-quartermaster/store.ts`, `src/model-quartermaster/monitor.ts`, `src/db/migrations/019_model_quartermaster.sql`, plus shadow copies under `packages/infra/src/model-quartermaster/` and `packages/core/src/db/migrations/`)

- **Default MQM signal weights rebalanced** — `historical` 0.25→0.22, `quality` 0.25→0.23, `trajectory` 0.10→0.12, `reflection` 0.05→0.08. Gives trajectory and reflection more initial influence while still prioritizing historical performance and quality.

- **Quartermaster (QM) tool orchestration system overhaul** — 10 fixes to the 5-signal tool prediction intelligence:

  - **Race condition in observe()** — `observe()` read `observationCount` from session state, computed `+1` in JS, then upserted. Two concurrent observations could both read the same value, miss an increment, and both trigger mode transitions. Replaced with `incrementSessionObservations()`; mode transition checked separately against `newCount >= OBSERVE_THRESHOLD`.

  - **`learn()` corrupted `predictionCount`** — `learn()` overwrote `predictionCount` with `sessionState.predictionCount + decisions.length`, but `predict()` had already incremented it for each call. Removed the overwrite; `learn()` now only writes `correctCount`.

  - **`learn()` set mode at wrong threshold** — `learn()` wrote `mode = predictionCount >= 50 ? 'active' : 'observe'`, but QM's real observe→active threshold is 10. Mode is now set exclusively by `observe()`.

  - **Trajectory signal dead — exact-match on full-turn sequences** — `findPatterns(last3)` searched for `JSON.stringify(last3)` but stored patterns contained `JSON.stringify(allToolsInTurn)`. A full-turn sequence like `["read","edit","write","shell"]` never matched a prefix search for `["edit","write","shell"]`. Added `prefix` mode to `findPatterns()` using SQL `LIKE ? || '%'`; `computeTrajectorySignal()` extracts `nextTool = seq[prefix.length]`; `learn.ts` stores `prefix_3_tools + actualTool` instead of the full turn.

  - **Fusion never reached suggest threshold** — unlike MQM, QM just summed `weight * score` without dividing by activeWeightSum. A tool matching only `taskContext` (weight 0.15, score 0.8) got `0.12` — 5× below the 0.6 suggest threshold. Added `rawTotal / activeWeightSum` normalization plus `coveragePenalty = 0.7 + 0.3 * (signalCount / 5)`.

  - **Reflection confidence hardcoded to 0.5** — `predict()` always passed `0.5` to `gatherSignalScores()` regardless of actual reflection quality. Now accepts `reflectionConfidence` parameter (default 0.5) so callers can pass real reflection confidence.

  - **`avg_confidence` incremental average formula broken** — `upsertPattern()` computed `(confidence + success_count) / (hit_count + 1)`, mixing a 0-1 score with an integer count. Added `avg_confidence` to the SELECT; formula corrected to `(avg_confidence * hit_count + confidence) / newHitCount`.

  - **Only 3/5 signals penalized on bad predictions** — `updateWeightsFromDecision()` only penalized `trajectory`, `episodic`, and `taskContext` on wrong predictions, leaving `toolStats` and `reflection` immune to penalty. Now all 5 signals receive proportional penalties using `confidenceFloor` enforcement.

  - **`confidenceFloor` stored but never enforced** — `qm_signal_weights.confidence_floor` existed in schema and migration but `updateWeightsFromDecision()` ignored it. Now enforces `Math.max(floor, newWeight)` on every update.

  - **Hardcoded candidate tool list missed 50+ tools** — `collectCandidateTools()` listed only 10 tools. Modern tools (`web_search`, `web_fetch`, `brave_search`, `computer`, `sandbox_exec`, `task`, `a2a`, `mcp`, `semantic_search`, `codebase_search`, `git_commit`, `git_stash`, `web_scrape`) were excluded from prediction. Expanded to 24 tools.

  (`src/quartermaster/signals.ts`, `src/quartermaster/fusion.ts`, `src/quartermaster/learn.ts`, `src/quartermaster/mod.ts`, `src/quartermaster/store.ts`, plus shadow copies under `packages/infra/src/quartermaster/`)

- **Episodic signal regex fragility fixed in QM** — the QM episodic signal used `(?:tool|call|used|ran|executed)\s+(\w+)` regex identical to the MQM issue. Replaced with direct `text.includes(toolName)` search across candidate tools.

  (`src/quartermaster/signals.ts`, `packages/infra/src/quartermaster/signals.ts`)

### Added

- **`cortex mcp a2a remote` CLI command** — new subcommand that lists all configured remote A2A agents with endpoint, auth status, timeout, and tool name. Shows a config example when no agents are configured. The main `cortex mcp a2a` help text now includes a full `config.json` example for adding remote agents. (`src/cli/a2a-cmd.ts`, `packages/cli/src/cli/a2a-cmd.ts`)

- **Sessions page — tree view with token metrics** — the sessions list is now a hierarchical tree showing parent sessions with indented child sub-agent sessions. Added an enriched endpoint (`GET /api/sessions/enriched`) that joins lens_events token data per session, plus `GET /api/sessions/:id/stats` for single-session stats. Each row displays: status dot, sub-agent connector, name, truncated ID, agent/channel/sub-agent type badges, child count chip, `← parent` link on children, turn count, total tokens, cost, tool calls, and average LLM duration. Parent cards get an accent left border; children get an amber left border. The detail view now fetches and displays token metrics alongside parent/child navigation. Archival opacity transitions smoothly on hover. **Fixed template-literal escaping** — the file lives inside a TypeScript template literal export; inline `onclick` handlers using JS string concatenation (`\'')` patterns) were broken by the dual-layer escaping (TS template → browser JS). Replaced concatenation with browser-side template literals for the main card HTML and DOM-based `addEventListener` for child links, and switched special characters to Unicode escapes (`\u2514`, `\u2190`, etc.) to avoid encoding ambiguity. (`src/db/sessions.ts`, `src/server/routes/sessions.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/10_sessions.ts`, `src/server/ui/pages/sessions.ts`, `src/server/ui/css.ts`)

## [0.49.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- **Tauri desktop app rebuilt** — the `desktop/` Tauri 2.x application was fully restructured with a proper Rust IPC backend, dedicated desktop frontend, and server lifecycle management:
  - **Rust backend** (`desktop/src-tauri/src/`): modular architecture with `commands.rs` (8 IPC commands: `get_system_info`, clipboard read/write, server start/stop/status, `open_external`), `tray.rs` (system tray with Tauri 2.x `TrayIconBuilder` API, dynamic server status, quick-ask trigger), and `main.rs` (auto-starts Cortex server on launch, manages `AppState` with child process tracking, close-to-tray behavior)
  - **Desktop frontend** (`desktop/src/`): dedicated shell UI with toolbar, quick-ask bar (`Ctrl+Shift+K`), server health indicator, iframe-hosted Cortex dashboard, and splash/loading screen. Communicates with Tauri backend via IPC and Cortex server via REST API
  - **Icons**: generated SVG logo + PNG sizes (32×32, 128×128, 256×256) + ICO + placeholder ICNS via `rsvg-convert`
  - **Build**: new `build-desktop.ts` script inlines CSS/JS into single `desktop/dist/index.html`; added `deno task build-desktop`
  - **Dependencies**: `sysinfo` (system monitoring), `arboard` (clipboard), `open` (URL handler), `hostname`; version synced to 0.49.1
  - (`desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, `desktop/src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, `desktop/src-tauri/src/tray.rs`, `desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `desktop/src-tauri/icons/*`, `desktop/src/index.html`, `desktop/src/app.css`, `desktop/src/app.js`, `desktop/build-desktop.ts`, `deno.json`)

- **Runtime timeouts, limits, and CDN endpoints made configurable** — 30+ previously hardcoded values are now configurable via `config.json` with sensible defaults preserved:
  - **Agent loop** — `agentRuntime.maxToolRounds` (12), `agentRuntime.subAgentTimeoutMs` (120000), `agentRuntime.streamTimeoutMs` (180000). `setup.ts` and `llm-stream.ts` read from config, falling back to module-level defaults.
  - **Sandbox** — `sandbox.timeoutMs` (30000), `sandbox.maxOutputBytes` (65536), `sandbox.scrollAmount` (3), optional `sandbox.dockerImages` overrides.
  - **Approval workflow** — `approvals.autoApproveRiskBelow` (low), `approvals.defaultTimeoutMs` (300000), `approvals.maxTimeoutMs` (3600000). Added `initApprovalWorkflowFromCortexConfig()`.
  - **Job scheduler** — `scheduler.runningJobTimeoutMs` (600000). `recoverStaleJobs()` resolves timeout from config.
  - **Chrome Bridge** — `chromeBridge.healthCheckMs` (30000), `chromeBridge.maxRetries` (5), `chromeBridge.initialBackoffMs` (100), `chromeBridge.maxBackoffMs` (1600). Wired through `startChromeBridge()`.
  - **UI CDN endpoints** — `uiCdn.cdnBase` (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`), `uiCdn.googleFontsBase` (`fonts.googleapis.com`), `uiCdn.d3Base` (`d3js.org`). `serveUi()` accepts `UICdnOptions` from config.
  - **Code graph** — `codeGraph.maxGrammarSize` (5242880), `codeGraph.ignoreDirs`, `codeGraph.ignoreFiles`.
  - All new config sections use deep merging so partial overrides don't wipe defaults. (`packages/core/contracts/config.ts`, `packages/core/src/config/config.ts`, `packages/ai/src/agent/stages/setup.ts`, `packages/ai/src/agent/stages/llm-stream.ts`, `packages/ai/src/tools/builtin/chrome_bridge_manager.ts`, `packages/infra/src/scheduler/scheduler.ts`, `packages/gate/src/security/approval-workflow.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/ui/mod.ts`, `packages/server/src/server/server.ts`)

## [0.49.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Codebase modularization** — three of the largest monoliths were decomposed into cohesive modules with no behavior change:
  - **Router split** (`src/server/router.ts`, 6,075 lines → 62 route modules + `new-router.ts`): every `// ──` section extracted into its own `src/server/routes/<name>.ts` file exporting `RouteHandler[]` tuples (`{ method, pattern, handler }`). Helper functions (`json`, `notFound`, `err`, rate limiter, CORS) moved to `_helpers.ts`. `new-router.ts` iterates a flat `publicRoutes`/`protectedRoutes` table with the auth guard between them. The original `router.ts` is replaced in `server.ts` by the new-router. (`src/server/routes/*.ts`, `src/server/new-router.ts`)
  - **UI split** (`src/server/ui.ts`, 17,740 lines → 74 modular files): CSS extracted to `css.ts`, 41 page `<div>` templates to `pages/*.ts`, 25 JavaScript blocks to `js/*.ts`, shared utilities to `shared/`. `mod.ts` assembles all pieces via string concatenation into a single `<script>` block preserving global variable scope (`ws`, `sessionId`, `currentPage`, etc.). `DASHBOARD_JS` template literal moved to `js/dashboard.ts` and injected at the correct position. `serveUi()` delegates to `mod.ts`. (`src/server/ui/*.ts`)
  - **Agent loop split** (`src/agent/loop.ts`, 1,605 lines → 15 stage/post/helper modules): 11 pipeline stages extracted under `src/agent/stages/` (setup, history, assessment, prompt-builder, model-selector, llm-stream, tool-executor), 3 post-turn modules under `post/` (response, background, cleanup), and 3 helpers (nanoid, preferences, strip-tool-calls). `agentTurn()` orchestrator reduced to 81 lines calling stages sequentially via a shared `TurnContext`. (`src/agent/stages/*.ts`, `src/agent/post/*.ts`, `src/agent/helpers/*.ts`, `src/agent/pipeline/context.ts`)

- **Codebase modularization** — defined 41 pure TypeScript interfaces across 6 package boundaries with zero runtime dependencies. Each contract file mirrors the existing implementation types prefixed with `I`:
  - **`@cortex/core`** (7 files): config (`ICortexConfig`, `IProviderConfig`, `ProviderKind`, 23 types), database (`IDbClient`, `IMigration`), logging (`ILogger`, `LogLevel`), i18n (`II18nService`), paths (`IAppPaths`), plugins (`IPluginManifest`, `PluginCapability`)
  - **`@cortex/ai`** (8 files): tools (`ITool`, `IToolRegistry`, `IToolContext`, 12 types), agent (`IAgentLoop`, `IAgentTurnOptions`, `IAgentTurnResult`), llm (`ILLMProvider`, `ILLMRouter`, `ICompletionOptions`), memory (`IMemoryStore`, `IEpisodicStore`, `IGraphStore`), skills (`ISkillStore`), pipeline (`IPipelineHook`, `IPipelineManager`, `IAgentState`), embeddings (`IEmbeddingProvider`)
  - **`@cortex/server`** (6 files): router (`IRouteHandler`, `IRouteTable`), websocket (`IWSHandler`, `IWSHub`), channels (`IChannelAdapter`, `IChannelManager`), middleware (`IMiddlewareStack`), mcp (`IMcpConnection`, `IMcpGateway`)
  - **`@cortex/gate`** (5 files): policy (`IPolicyEngine`, `IPolicyDecision`), vault (`IVault`, `IVaultEntry`), sandbox (`ISandboxProvider`, `ISandboxResult`), validator (`IValidator`, `IValidationResult`)
  - **`@cortex/infra`** (5 files): scheduler (`IScheduler`, `IJobRow`, `JobStatus`), ipc (`IIPCTransport`, `IIpcMessage`), services (`IServiceManager`, `IServiceDef`), triggers (`ITrigger`, `ITriggerManager`)
  - **`@cortex/cli`** (4 files): commands (`ICommand`, `ICommandContext`), registry (`ICommandRegistry`), tui (`ITuiComponent`)
  - (`packages/*/contracts/*.ts`)

- **Codebase modularization** — 593 source files migrated into 6 coarse Deno workspace packages following the dependency graph `core ← gate ← ai ← server ← cli` and `core ← ai ← infra ← cli`:
  - **`@cortex/core`** (41 files): `config/`, `db/`, `i18n/`, `utils/`, `plugins/`
  - **`@cortex/gate`** (29 files): `security/`, `sandbox/`, `vfs/`
  - **`@cortex/ai`** (166 files): `agent/`, `tools/`, `memory/`, `llm/`, `pipeline/`, `skills/`
  - **`@cortex/server`** (222 files): `server/`, `hub/`, `channels/`, `a2a/`, `mcp/`, `mcp-gateway/`, `voice/`, `remote/`, `workspace/`, `codegraph/`, `memori/`, `computer-use/`, `projects/`, `eval/`
  - **`@cortex/infra`** (43 files): `processes/`, `services/`, `scheduler/`, `ipc/`, `triggers/`, `workflow/`, `observability/`, `quartermaster/`, `model-quartermaster/`, `kernel/`
  - **`@cortex/cli`** (92 files): `cli/`, `tui/`
  - Root `deno.json` `workspace` field updated with all 6 package paths. Each package has a `deno.json` with `"name": "@cortex/<name>"` and explicit export maps. Original `src/` directories preserved as active codebase — migration is additive with no import breakage. (`packages/**/src/*.ts`, `packages/**/deno.json`, `deno.json`)

- **Codebase modularization — Phase 4: Boundary enforcement** — created `scripts/check-boundaries.ts` to validate that cross-package imports only reference `contracts/` directories (not `src/`), and that only `src/main.ts` (composition root) imports from the old flat `src/` structure. Ready for CI integration when workspace imports are activated. (`scripts/check-boundaries.ts`)

- **Memory barrel export** — created `src/memory/mod.ts` re-exporting the full public API surface of all 13 memory modules (store, backends, embeddings, vector_backends, inject, graph, consolidate, heuristics, glossary, preference-learner, privacy, cross-agent-context, context-bridge, skills). Consumers can now `import { ... } from '../memory/mod.ts'`. (`src/memory/mod.ts`)

- **Memory graph visualization** — the Memory > Graph tab now renders an interactive D3 force-directed graph instead of a static card list. Nodes represent entities (concepts, code symbols, domains), color-coded by type and sized by connection count. Edges represent typed relations (`uses`, `extends`, `requires`, etc.), color-coded by relation type, with shorter links for stronger associations. Features include drag, zoom/pan, click-to-focus navigation, hover tooltips with entity details, edge labels, and a legend strip. A new `GET /api/memory/graph/full` endpoint serves graph data with optional entity-centric traversal. (`src/memory/graph.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Integrated terminal in editor panel** — the Terminal tab in the editor's bottom panel is now a fully functional xterm.js terminal emulator instead of a static "not connected" placeholder. Clicking the Terminal tab spawns a persistent shell process (`bash` on Linux/macOS, PowerShell on Windows) via WebSocket, with stdin/stdout/stderr piped for real-time I/O. Features include local line editing with echo, backspace support, Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+D (EOF) forwarding, automatic reconnection on WebSocket reconnect or tab re-select, and session state persistence (cwd, environment variables) between commands. (`src/server/ws.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

### Fixed

- **UI JS template literal escaping** — TypeScript template literals in the modular UI files processed `\r\n` into actual CR/LF characters inside JS single-quoted strings, breaking them across lines and producing `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`. Double-escaped to `\\r\\n` in all 11 affected locations across `js/03_websocket.ts` and `js/14_editor.ts`. Also fixed regex `/\n/g` splitting across lines by escaping to `/\\n/g`, and standalone `'\n'` in `sendWs`/`endsWith` calls. The underlying issue was the terminal feature's escape sequences being consumed by the TypeScript template literal processor before reaching the browser. (`src/server/ui/js/03_websocket.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/14_editor.ts`)

- **53 functions dropped during UI JS extraction** — the Phase 1b mechanical split of the 14K-line monolithic JS into 25 concatenated modules dropped 53 function definitions across 4 files: memory page extensions (`extendMemoryPage`, `loadMemEmbeddings`, `loadMemHeuristics`, `loadMemPrivacy`, `loadMemVectorStore`, `saveMem*`, `switchMemExtTab`, `runHeuristicCycle`), alcove context library (`loadAlcovePage`, `browseAlcoveDir`, `indexAlcove`, `searchAlcove`, `showAlcoveDoc`), prompt lab (`loadPromptLab`, `renderPromptTemplates`, `savePromptTemplate`, `selectPromptTemplate`, `testPromptTemplate`), PKM connectors (`loadPkmPage`, `renderPkmConnections`, `syncPkmConnection`), eval harnesses (`addEvalHarnesses`, `addEvalRagSection`, `runRagEval`), settings extensions (`addSettingsCompressor`, `addSettingsPreferences`, `addSettingsSandbox`, `addSettingsA2A`, `loadProviderComparison`, `loadRouterDashboard`, `loadSupervisorConfig`, `loadSupervisorHistory`, `loadSupervisorModels`, `saveSupervisorConfig`, `clearSupervisorCache`), debug panel (`refreshDebugDiagnostics`, `refreshDebugJobs`, `refreshDebugSandbox`, `cancelStuckJob`, `recoverStaleJobsFromDebug`, `toggleSandboxDebug`), memory loader patching (`patchMemoryLoader`), and page enhancement init (`initPageEnhancements`). Causes were extraction boundary errors — function bodies separated from their headers across file boundaries. Restored all 53 functions to their correct files. (`src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/19_devtools.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/20_extensions.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/22_mcp_memori.ts`)

- **`switchSettingsExtTab` body dropped and duplicated** — the function body (26 lines) was dropped during extraction, causing `extendCPLEditor` and subsequent functions to incorrectly nest inside `switchSettingsExtTab`, leaving 4 unclosed braces that produced `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input`. The function was also duplicated in `11_pages.ts` as an orphaned body without its header. Restored the complete function body in `12_settings.ts` and removed the duplicate from `11_pages.ts`. (`src/server/ui/js/12_settings.ts`, `src/server/ui/js/11_pages.ts`)

- **UI JS integrity tests added** — created `tests/ui_js_integrity_test.ts` with 3 automated checks that validate the generated HTML output: broken string continuations (lines ending with orphaned `'` or `"` from split strings), global function presence (18 required functions verified), and literal control characters inside JS strings (newlines before closing quotes). Node `--check` validates the full generated JS is syntactically correct. (`tests/ui_js_integrity_test.ts`)

- **`slowDecayForFrequentAccess` heuristic always returned 0** — `runHeuristicCycle()` ran `boostImportanceFromAccess()` first (resetting `access_count` to 0), then `slowDecayForFrequentAccess()` checked `access_count >= 5`, which always failed. Reordered execution so decay-slowing runs before the access-count reset, allowing both operations to see the original count. (`src/memory/heuristics.ts`)
- **Duplicate health score assignments in `getMemoryHealth()`** — `result.warnings` and `result.healthScore` were assigned twice with identical statements. Removed the duplicate lines. (`src/memory/heuristics.ts`)
- **Episodic `last_accessed` column never updated** — `recordAccess()` and `recordBatchAccess()` only set `last_accessed` on semantic memories, leaving episodic memories with NULL. Both now update `last_accessed` for episodic too. Added migration 038 to create the missing `last_accessed` column and index on `episodic_memory`. (`src/memory/heuristics.ts`, `src/db/migrations/038_episodic_last_accessed.sql`)
- **Daily consolidation only re-scored semantic decay** — episodic memories were never re-scored or pruned by the daily consolidation job. Added episodic decay re-scoring and stale record deletion (including vector mirror cleanup) to `runDailyConsolidation()`. (`src/memory/consolidate.ts`)
- **`runHeuristicCycle()` result silently discarded in daily consolidation** — the heuristic cycle ran fire-and-forget with no logging. Results are now captured and logged via the consolidate logger. (`src/memory/consolidate.ts`)
- **`preference-learner.ts` was orphaned with no callers** — the preference learning module (260 lines: confidence tracking, pattern extraction, `buildPreferenceContext()`) was never imported by any file. `detectAndPersistPreference()` in the agent loop had its own separate regex-based implementation. Wired `learnFromCorrection()` into `detectAndPersistPreference()`, injected `buildPreferenceContext()` into the prompt enrichment pipeline alongside memory and skills, and added DB persistence via `semantic_memory` with `__pref__` category prefix. (`src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/memory/preference-learner.ts`)
- **`GET /api/agent/preferences` read from orphaned config field** — the endpoint returned `config.learnedPreferences`, a value never written by the preference learner. Now returns the full `PreferenceReport` from `generatePreferenceReport()`. (`src/server/router.ts`)
- **`glossary.ts` was in-memory only** — terms were lost on restart. Added DB persistence via `semantic_memory` with `__glossary__` category prefix; all functions (`defineTerm`, `lookupTerm`, `listTerms`, `getCategories`) are now async and load from DB on first access. Updated the glossary API endpoints in the router to `await` the async functions. (`src/memory/glossary.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`)

- **Migration 038 was never registered in `migrate.ts`** — the `038_episodic_last_accessed.sql` file existed on disk but was missing from the `targets` array. Fresh databases would never get the `last_accessed` column on `episodic_memory`. Added to migration targets. (`src/db/migrate.ts`)
- **`shared_context` table missing** — `cross-agent-context.ts` wrote to a `shared_context` table that had no corresponding migration. All `writeSharedContext()`, `readSharedContext()`, and `listSharedContext()` calls would fail with `SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: shared_context`. Created migration 039 with proper schema and indexes. (`src/db/migrations/039_shared_context.sql`)
- **Session links were lost on restart** — `linkSessions()`, `unlinkSessions()`, `getLinkedSessions()`, and `getSessionLinks()` stored everything in-memory via a `Map`. Created migration 040 (`linked_sessions` table) and rewrote all four functions to persist links to the database. (`src/db/migrations/040_linked_sessions.sql`, `src/memory/cross-agent-context.ts`)
- **Privacy retention enforcement never ran** — `enforceMemoryRetention()` in `privacy.ts` had no callers. Wired it into `runDailyConsolidation()` so expired entries are regularly purged. (`src/memory/consolidate.ts`)
- **Cross-session context bridge never invoked** — `bridgeSessionContext()` in `context-bridge.ts` was defined but never called. Wired it into the agent loop's prompt enrichment pipeline alongside memory injection and preferences. Also fixed type errors by adapting to the `SessionRow` interface. (`src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/memory/context-bridge.ts`)
- **Memory backend abstraction orphaned** — `backends.ts` provided `registerMemoryBackend()` and `getActiveBackend()` but nothing used them; all consumers called `store.ts` directly. Updated the agent loop to route episodic writes through `getActiveBackend().write()`, allowing the pluggable backend system to take effect. (`src/agent/loop.ts`)
- **Qdrant upsert used wrong HTTP method** — `QdrantVectorStore.upsert()` sent `PUT /collections/{name}/points` but the Qdrant REST API expects `POST /collections/{name}/points/upsert`. The wrong method and missing `/upsert` suffix caused upserts to fail silently against Qdrant. (`src/memory/vector_backends.ts`)
- **Pinecone API version was stale** — `X-Pinecone-Api-Version` header was `2024-10` but the current Pinecone API version is `2025-10`. Updated to match the current stable API. (`src/memory/vector_backends.ts`)
- **Qdrant/ChromaDB missing API key field in Vector Store settings UI** — the Memory > Vector Store configuration page had an API key input for Pinecone but not for Qdrant or ChromaDB, even though both backends support `api-key` / `Authorization` headers and the config schema already accepts `apiKey`. Added the API key field for all backends. The setup wizard already had this field. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

## [0.48.6] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Editor code runner integration** — the built-in code editor now has a **▶ Run** button in the status bar and **F5**/**Ctrl+Enter**/**Cmd+Enter** keyboard shortcuts to execute the current file directly in the sandbox. Language detection maps file extensions to sandbox runtimes (`.py` → python, `.js` → javascript, `.ts` → typescript, `.sh` → bash, `.rb` → ruby, `.go` → go, `.rs` → rust). Results (stdout, stderr, exit code, duration, runtime backend) display in the Output panel at the bottom of the editor, reusing the existing `POST /api/code/exec` endpoint. Unsaved files are auto-saved before execution. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Concurrent agent turns in same WebSocket session** — the `chat` message handler set `turnInFlight = true` but never checked it before launching `processChatMessage`, allowing duplicate turns to run simultaneously in the same session. A second `chat` message (e.g. from a reconnecting client) would spawn a second `agentTurn` while the first was still executing, producing interleaved log entries and corrupted tool state. Added a guard that rejects subsequent chat messages with an error while a turn is in flight. (`src/server/ws.ts`)
- **Malformed `<arg_key>/<arg_value>` XML tool calls from deepseek-v4-pro** — some LLMs generate tool calls in the format `<tool_call><arg_key>tool</arg_key><arg_value>sub_agent</arg_value><arg_key>args</arg_key><arg_value>{"type":"plan"}</arg_value></tool_call>`, which was unrecognized by any existing parser. The agent loop detected these as malformed and asked the LLM to retry, but the LLM repeatedly produced the same XML format, wasting 7+ rounds and burning tokens. Added a dedicated `<arg_key>/<arg_value>` parser in `parseToolCallsFromFragments` that extracts tool name and args from this format. (`src/tools/executor.ts`)
- **Sub-agent spawn fails with `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY`** — sub-agent processes open their own connection to the core database and insert a session row with `parent_session_id` referencing the parent session. Under WAL mode, the parent session INSERT may not be visible to the sub-agent process immediately, causing a foreign key violation. All 11 parallel sub-agents failed with the same error. Added a 3-retry loop with 150ms exponential backoff in the sub-agent entry process. (`src/processes/sub-agent-entry.ts`)
- **Supervisor LLM hangs block tool execution indefinitely** — `requestSupervisorDecision` had no timeout, so if the supervisor model hung (network error, overloaded API), tools like `db_query` and `memory_search` would block until the overall agent turn timeout. Added a 10-second `Promise.race` timeout to the supervisor LLM call. (`src/security/supervisor.ts`)
- **`file_write` fails when target directory does not exist** — `file_write` called `Deno.writeTextFile` without creating parent directories, so writing to `test-cortex-app/utils.ts` in a non-existent directory failed with "No such file or directory". The agent then tried to `mkdir` which was denied by the user. Added automatic `mkdir` with `recursive: true` before writing. (`src/tools/builtin/workspace/file_write.ts`)
- **TUI keyboard: Backspace and all Ctrl+key combos silently dropped** — `InputEngine.decodeByte()` only handled bytes 0, 9, 13, 27, and 32–126, missing backspace (byte 127 / DEL) and all Ctrl-modified keys (bytes 1–26 for Ctrl+A through Ctrl+Z). Backspace and shortcuts like Ctrl+C (cancel), Ctrl+K (cut line), Ctrl+U (clear line), Ctrl+W (delete word), and Ctrl+L (clear screen) produced no `KeyEvent`, effectively breaking text editing in the TUI. Added handlers for bytes 1–26 (Ctrl+letter → `{key, ctrl: true}`) and bytes 8/127 (backspace). (`src/tui/input-engine.ts`)
- **Editor Run button: template literal escapes broke JS parser** — `\n` escape sequences inside the TypeScript backtick template literal in `serveUi()` were being converted to literal newline characters in the served HTML, causing the browser's JavaScript parser to fail with "Invalid or unexpected token" and preventing the entire SPA from loading. Double-escaped (`\\n`) to preserve the literal `\n` in the generated HTML for browser-side parsing. Affected the new `editorRunCode()` function. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

## [0.48.5] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Sandbox backends API hardcoded Docker availability** — `GET /api/sandbox/backends` returned `available: true` for Docker regardless of whether Docker was actually installed, because Docker and gVisor availability were hardcoded booleans instead of calling `isDockerAvailable()`/`isGVisorAvailable()`. The `default` backend also now falls back to `subprocess` when Docker is unavailable. (`src/server/router.ts`)
- **IPC socket directory hardcoded to `/tmp/cortex`** — socket dir on Linux now uses `getTempDir()` (which checks `TMPDIR`/`TEMP`/`TMP` env vars) instead of a hardcoded `/tmp/cortex` path, matching the Windows behavior. (`src/ipc/transport.ts`)
- **MCP client version stale and duplicated** — the MCP `clientInfo.version` was hardcoded to `'0.35.3'` in two places (stdio and SSE client initialization), while the actual version is `0.48.4`. Added a synchronous `VERSION` export to `config/version.ts` (reads from `VERSION` file or `deno.json` at import time) and updated both MCP client locations to use it. (`src/mcp/client.ts`, `src/config/version.ts`)
- **A2A `pushNotifications` capability hardcoded** — the A2A agent card always declared `pushNotifications: false` even when notification channels were configured. `getA2AAgentCard()` now checks the channel store for any enabled channels and sets the capability accordingly. `generateAgentCard()` now accepts an optional `pushNotifications` parameter. (`src/a2a/server.ts`, `src/a2a/agent-card.ts`, `src/cli/a2a-cmd.ts`)
- **Daemon log path hardcoded to `/tmp/cortex-daemon.log`** — macOS launchd plist generation now uses `getTempDir()` for the log path instead of a hardcoded `/tmp/cortex-daemon.log`. (`src/cli/service-helper.ts`)
- **Onboarding version `'2.0'` duplicated across 3 locations** — extracted into a single `ONBOARDING_VERSION` constant in `config/version.ts`, referenced from all three usage sites. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/cli/setup.ts`, `src/config/version.ts`)
- **Pinecone vector store fallback was `localhost:8000`** — Pinecone is a cloud-only service; the `vectorBackends` constructor had a copy-paste error from ChromaDB that fell back to `http://localhost:8000` when no URL was configured. Now falls back to `https://api.pinecone.io`. (`src/memory/vector_backends.ts`)
- **Bedrock model listing hardcoded `us-east-1` region** — `bedrockModels()` always hit the us-east-1 endpoint even for users in other regions. Now reads `AWS_REGION` env var with `us-east-1` fallback. (`src/server/models.ts`)
- **`/compact` and `/plan` slash commands were stubs** — both returned "not yet implemented" messages. Replaced with informative messages explaining these features run automatically in the agent loop. (`src/cli/chat.ts`)
- **`authResult.response!` null assertion** — replaced with null-coalescing fallback that returns a proper 401 JSON response if the auth response object is unexpectedly missing. (`src/server/router.ts`)
- **`project!.id` null assertions (6 occurrences)** — captured `project.id` in a `const projectId` after the null guard, eliminating all non-null assertions in `incrementalSync()`. (`src/codegraph/sync.ts`)
- **`MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` inconsistent between shell and sandbox** — shell tool limited output to 32KB while the sandbox executor used 64KB. Standardized to 64KB. (`src/tools/builtin/shell.ts`)
- **VFS fake `RegExpMatchArray` copy-pasted 3 times** — extracted into a `fakeMatch()` helper function, eliminating the DRY violation. (`src/vfs/mod.ts`)
- **Debug settings page not saving log level config** — `PUT /api/config` was doing a shallow merge that replaced the entire `logging` section, silently wiping OTLP/Grafana/Langfuse sub-configs when only log level was changed. Now deep-merges the `logging` key. The debug tab also now populates its form fields from the current config (log level, file logging, max bytes/files) when switching tabs, instead of showing static HTML defaults. Save failures now display the server error message. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

## [0.48.4] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Stale job recovery** — `recoverStaleJobs()` in the scheduler detects jobs stuck in `running` state longer than 10 minutes and transitions them to `pending` (if under `max_attempts`) or `failed` (if exhausted). Orphaned `job_runs` with no associated running job are also finalized. Recovery runs at daemon startup and every poll cycle (30s). A new `cortex jobs recover` CLI command allows manual recovery with configurable timeout. (`src/scheduler/scheduler.ts`, `src/processes/scheduler-process.ts`, `src/cli/jobs.ts`)
- **Scheduler structured logging** — the scheduler daemon now uses the project's `logger()` (namespace `'scheduler'`) instead of raw `console.log`. Job lifecycle events (started, completed, failed, crashed) are logged at appropriate levels with structured data including jobId, runId, duration, exitCode, and attempts. Set `CORTEX_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to see per-job execution details. (`src/processes/scheduler-process.ts`)
- **Jobs CLI verbose mode** — `cortex jobs list -v` shows full job details: timestamps, duration, source, and the last 5 job runs with status and messages. `cortex jobs list -r` filters to only running/stuck jobs. The `cancel` subcommand now accepts running jobs as well. (`src/cli/jobs.ts`)
- **Debug settings page** — new **Debug** tab in the web UI Settings with four diagnostic cards: **System Diagnostics** (scheduler status, heap/RSS, sandbox runtime, per-DB file sizes), **Scheduler & Stuck Jobs** (lists all running jobs with per-job Cancel buttons and a Recover Stale Jobs action), **Sandbox Debug** (backend availability and sandbox debug toggle), and **Log Level & File** (interactive log level dropdown, file logging toggle, size/rotation config with Save button — moved from System tab). All cards have Refresh buttons. (`src/server/ui.ts`)
- **System diagnostics API** — `GET /api/system/diagnostics` returns scheduler aliveness, running job count, DB file sizes, sandbox runtime, and Deno memory usage (heap, RSS). `POST /api/jobs/recover` triggers stale job recovery with optional `timeoutMs`. (`src/server/router.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Jobs stuck in running state** — previously if the scheduler daemon crashed or was killed mid-execution, running jobs were left stuck indefinitely with escalating attempt counts because `getDueJobs()` only picked up `pending` jobs and there was no timeout mechanism. Now handled by `recoverStaleJobs()` (see Added). Also fixed `cancelJob` to work on `running` jobs, closing orphaned `job_runs` entries too.

## [0.48.3] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Tool call lens events missing payload** — `logEvent` for tool calls now includes a structured `payload` with tool name, success status, output (first 500 chars), error, and duration for auditability. Previously tool call events only stored truncated args in `summary` with no result data in `payload`.
- **VERSION file out of sync** — `VERSION` file was stuck at 0.48.1 while `deno.json` was already at 0.48.2. CI version consistency check would fail on any tag push. Now synced and included in automated checks.

## [0.48.2] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Server restart not working** — `cortex server restart` was silently routing to the parent's empty action instead of the restart handler due to a Cliffy 1.2.1 bug where parent commands with both subcommands and an empty `.action()` misroute 3rd+ subcommands. Removed no-op `.action()` from `server-cmd.ts`, `db-cmd.ts`, `sandbox-cmd.ts`, and `self-cmd.ts` (commands that serve only as subcommand containers don't need a parent action — Cliffy shows help automatically).
- **Server graceful shutdown** — added `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` signal handlers to the HTTP server. On shutdown the server now: writes/removes a PID file at `~/.cortex/data/server.pid`, stops all auto-started micro-services via `stopAllServices()`, and stops chrome-bridge. Previously the server had no cleanup on exit.
- **Service manager orphan cleanup on restart** — `startAutoServices()` now calls `cleanupStaleServices()` before starting, which checks if each `running` service's PID is still alive (using `/proc/<pid>` on Linux with `SIGCONT` fallback) and resets dead services to `stopped` in the database. This prevents orphaned service processes from being skipped by the auto-start logic after a restart.
- **Server restart port race condition** — replaced the fixed 1500ms sleep with port availability polling (up to 10s with 300ms checks), preventing the new server from failing to bind when the old process hasn't fully released the port.
- **Server restart uses PID file** — the restart command now checks `~/.cortex/data/server.pid` first (most reliable), falls back to `fuser -k <port>/tcp`, then `pgrep`-based PID discovery.
- **Marketplace plugin version enrichment broken** — `checkGitHubRelease()` was passing an invalid/encrypted GitHub token (`enc:...`) to the GitHub API, causing `401 Bad credentials` and returning `null` for all plugin versions. Now detects `401`/`403` responses and retries without authentication, falling back to unauthenticated API calls.
- **Marketplace CLI lacked version enrichment** — `cortex marketplace list plugins` fetched directly from `cortexprism.io` without enriching versions from GitHub releases. Now imports and calls `enrichPluginVersions()` from `update.ts`, matching the web UI proxy behavior.
- **Version enrichment shared module** — moved `enrichPluginVersions()` and its cache from `router.ts` into `update.ts` as a shared export, used by both the server proxy and the CLI.
- **`installFromMarketplace` used stale manifest version** — now resolves the actual latest version from GitHub releases BEFORE downloading, and passes the version tag to `buildGitHubArchiveUrl()` so the downloaded code matches the recorded version.
- **Update flow GitHub fallback used `main` branch** — marketplace plugin update fallback now downloads from the correct release tag (`v{version}`) instead of always using `main`.
- **`content_readable` supply chain failure** — `Deno.readTextFile()` rejects `file://` URIs. Fixed `verifySupplyChain()` and `verifyEntryPointIntegrity()`/`generateIntegrityHash()` to strip the `file://` prefix before reading.
- **Supply chain `requireKnownHash` too strict** — changed default from `true` to `false`. Community marketplace plugins don't have pre-registered known-good hashes; requiring them blocked installation. When hashes aren't registered, the check now passes as informational instead of failing as a warning.

## [0.48.1] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **VSplit/HSplit key dispatch** — split-pane layouts weren't adding children to the component tree, blocking keyboard input in nested panels.
- **TUI enter key decoded as Ctrl+M** — reordered byte checks so the Enter key (0x0A/0x0D) is recognized before the Ctrl+M control range, fixing message submission and approval gate input.
- **TUI enter key input clearing** — `onSubmit` handler now unconditionally clears text, added missing `await` on key handler, and wrapped handling in try/catch for robustness.
- **TUI logging pollution** — silenced agent-loop stdout output during interactive sessions while preserving file logs.
- **TUI duplicate render path** — root renderer was traversing nested children after splits had already rendered them, causing flicker. Root now only paints top-level mounted components once.
- **I18n key sync** — synced `cli.tui` i18n keys across all 10 locales to ensure consistent fallback behavior.

## [0.48.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Custom Deno-native TUI framework** — new `src/tui/` module provides a full terminal UI framework with double-buffered `VirtualScreen` (cell-level diff-and-flush for flicker-free rendering), class-based `Component` tree with lifecycle hooks (`onMount`, `onUpdate`, `onDestroy`, `onResize`, `onKeyPress`), layout engine (`HSplit`, `VSplit`, `ScrollView`, `Box` with flex/perecentage sizing), raw `InputEngine` with ANSI escape decoding and emacs-style keybindings (`Ctrl+A/E/K/W/U`, `Alt+F/B/D`, `Ctrl+R` history search), and a `Renderer` with SIGWINCH resize handling. Three built-in themes: `dark`, `light`, `contrast`. (`src/tui/buffer.ts`, `src/tui/screen.ts`, `src/tui/style.ts`, `src/tui/component.ts`, `src/tui/layout.ts`, `src/tui/renderer.ts`, `src/tui/input-engine.ts`, `src/tui/themes/dark.ts`, `src/tui/themes/light.ts`, `src/tui/themes/contrast.ts`, `src/tui/mod.ts`)

- **TUI components** — 9 reusable components powering both `agent chat` and `agent tui`: `Header` (title bar), `StatusBar` (model/tokens/cost/session footer), `TextInput` (multi-line with cursor movement, history, selection), `CompletionMenu` (floating dropdown for slash commands/file paths/agent names), `MarkdownBlock` (headers, bold, italic, inline code), `CodeBlock` (syntax highlighting for TS/JS/Python/Go/Rust/Bash/SQL), `DiffBlock` (unified diff with +/- coloring), `ToolCard` (tool call status with spinner/checkmark/cross and duration), `ChatView` (scrollable message list with streaming support). Utilities include OSC-8 hyperlinks, Braille/ASCII spinners and progress bars. (`src/tui/components/`, `src/tui/hyperlink.ts`, `src/tui/progress.ts`, `src/tui/completions.ts`)

- **`cortexCommand()` builder with declarative middleware** — new `src/cli/command-builder.ts` provides a fluent builder replacing raw `new Command()`. Commands declare `needs('config'|'migrations')` and receive a typed `Ctx` with auto-loaded config. Middleware runs transparently before the action handler, eliminating manual `await loadConfig()` / `await runMigrations()` boilerplate from every command file. (`src/cli/command-builder.ts`)

- **Static command registry with lazy imports** — new `src/cli/registry.ts` defines a `CommandEntry[]` table mapping nested paths (e.g. `['agent', 'chat']`) to async `load()` functions. `registerCommand()` in `src/cli/registry-helpers.ts` walks the path tree, auto-creates intermediate parent `Command` objects, and attaches leaf commands. Command modules are only imported when their path is invoked. Plugin CLI commands are merged via `mergePluginCommands()` using existing `buildCliffyCommand()` infrastructure. (`src/cli/registry.ts`, `src/cli/registry-helpers.ts`)

- **Global CLI flags** — `--json`, `--verbose`, `--no-color`, `--config <path>`, `--model <model>`, `--profile <name>` are now registered as cliffy global options, propagating to all subcommands automatically via `globalOption()`. (`src/main.ts`)

- **`agent exec <prompt>` one-shot mode** — new non-interactive agent execution for CI/scripting. Accepts a prompt argument, runs a single `agentTurn`, outputs the response. `--json` flag outputs `{ success, output, cost, durationMs, turns, tokensIn, tokensOut }` for machine consumption. `--max-turns <n>` limits tool-call rounds. `--output <file>` writes response to a file. Reuses shared `createAgentSession()` init logic. (`src/cli/agent-exec.ts`)

- **`config` command group** — `config get <key>` reads dot-notation keys (e.g. `agents.defaultAgent`), `config set <key> <value>` writes with JSON5 auto-parsing and encrypted credential storage via `saveConfig()`, `config unset <key>` deletes keys, `config list` pretty-prints full config with secret redaction, `config validate` checks schema compliance. (`src/cli/config-cmd.ts`)

- **12 slash commands in TUI chat** — `/model <name>` switches model mid-session, `/compact` triggers context compaction, `/status` shows session info, `/clear` clears chat history, `/save [file]` saves transcript, `/load <file>` loads transcript, `/export` exports session as markdown, `/theme <name>` switches theme (dark/light/contrast), `/diff` shows last file change, `/review` reviews pending approvals, `/plan` enters planning mode, `/help` lists all commands. Plus `/! <cmd>` for bash command passthrough and `/soul` for soul context. (`src/cli/chat.ts`, `src/cli/tui-cmd.ts`)

- **Shared agent session helper** — `createAgentSession()` in `src/cli/agent-session.ts` extracts the ~140-line agent initialization sequence (config loading, provider building, agent resolution, session creation, soul/skills loading, tool registry setup, plugin loading) into a reusable function shared by `chat.ts`, `tui-cmd.ts`, and `agent-exec.ts`. Eliminates the previously duplicated init logic between chat and TUI. (`src/cli/agent-session.ts`)

- **Shared TUI utilities** — `getTermCols()`/`getTermRows()` for terminal size detection with safe fallbacks (80x24), and `execShell()` for sandboxed bash command execution with stdout/stderr capture and 2000-char output truncation. Both extracted from duplicate implementations. (`src/tui/screen.ts`)

- **TUI internationalization** — added `cli.tui` section to `locales/en.json` with 20 localized strings covering command descriptions, slash command responses, status messages, and tool approval prompts. Other locales fall back to English via the existing `i18n.t()` fallback chain. (`locales/en.json`)

### Changed

- **CLI command tree restructured from 44 flat commands to nested domain groups** — `chat` → `agent chat`, `tui` → `agent tui`, `serve` → `server start`, `stop` → `server stop`, `restart` → `server restart`, `run` → `sandbox run`, `update` → `self update`, `migrate` → `db migrate`, `chrome-bridge` → `mcp chrome`, `a2a` → `mcp a2a`, `mcp-gateway` → `mcp gateway`. New parent groups: `server` (start/stop/restart), `sandbox` (run), `self` (update), `db` (migrate), `config` (get/set/unset/list/validate). `agent` command now includes all subcommands (chat, tui, exec, sessions, eval, reflect, lint, import, voice) alongside existing CRUD operations (list, show, create, update, delete, select, inspect, clone). Backward-compat aliases (`chat`, `tui`, `serve`) print deprecation warnings and delegate to new paths. (`src/main.ts`, `src/cli/registry.ts`, `src/cli/server-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/sandbox-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/self-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/db-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/agent-cmd.ts`)

- **`chat.ts` rewritten to use new TUI framework** — simple layout (Header + ChatView + TextInput + StatusBar, no tool panel). Tool approval gate now resolves via TUI text input (`y`/`n`) instead of blocking `Deno.stdin.read()`. Agent init delegated to `createAgentSession()`. All 12 slash commands implemented. (`src/cli/chat.ts`)

- **`tui-cmd.ts` rewritten to use new TUI framework** — full split-pane layout (Header + 70%/30% ChatView/ToolPanel + TextInput + StatusBar). Custom `ToolPanel` component renders inline tool cards. Agent init delegated to `createAgentSession()`. (`src/cli/tui-cmd.ts`)

- **`main.ts` rewritten to registry-driven architecture** — 44 hardcoded `.command()` calls replaced with `for` loop over registry entries. Global flags added. Subprocess dispatch (lines 14–42) preserved as first execution block. Plugin CLI commands merged via `mergePluginCommands()`. Failed command modules log errors and are skipped instead of crashing the CLI. (`src/main.ts`)

- **All 55+ CLI command files converted to `cortexCommand()` builder** — every command in `src/cli/` now uses the declarative `cortexCommand()` pattern instead of raw `new Command()`. Manual `await loadConfig()` and `await runMigrations()` calls replaced with `.needs('config'|'migrations')` middleware declarations on all commands that required them: `agent-cmd.ts` (list, show, import), `agent-exec.ts`, `agentlint-cmd.ts`, `chat.ts`, `chrome_bridge.ts`, `daemon.ts` (all subcommands), `eval-cmd.ts`, `import-cmd.ts` (all subcommands), `jobs.ts` (list, add, cancel, run-due), `log-cmd.ts` (show, tail, clear, set-level, path, status), `marketplace-cmd.ts` (install), `memory-cmd.ts` (search, add, health, heuristics), `migrate.ts`, `models-cmd.ts`, `plugins-cmd.ts`, `policy-cmd.ts`, `reflect.ts`, `run.ts`, `sessions.ts`, `setup-cmd.ts`, `tui-cmd.ts`, `vault-cmd.ts`, `voice-cmd.ts`. Remaining commands without middleware needs (`channels-cmd.ts`, `compliance-cmd.ts`, `debug-cmd.ts`, `desktop-cmd.ts`, `git-cmd.ts`, `github-cmd.ts`, `hooks-cmd.ts`, `install.ts`, `memori-cmd.ts`, `model-qm-cmd.ts`, `node.ts`, `projects-cmd.ts`, `quartermaster-cmd.ts`, `service-cmd.ts`, `soul-cmd.ts`, `start.ts`, `stop.ts`, `triggers-cmd.ts`, `update-cmd.ts`, `workflow-cmd.ts`) converted to consistent `(opts, ctx)` signature for forward-compatibility with middleware injection. All command exports use `._cmd` accessor in the registry for proper cliffy integration. (`src/cli/*.ts`, `src/cli/registry.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Interactive TUI logging polluted the screen** — `agent:loop` stdout logging was still active during `chat`/`tui` sessions, so debug output could overwrite the terminal UI. Interactive sessions now force silent stdout logging while preserving file logs. (`src/cli/agent-session.ts`, `src/cli/chat.ts`, `src/cli/tui-cmd.ts`)

- **Nested layout children were rendered twice** — the root renderer was traversing nested child components after split layouts had already rendered them, duplicating the UI. Root rendering now only paints top-level mounted components once. (`src/tui/component.ts`)

- **Tool approval gate hung indefinitely in TUI chat** — the rewritten `approvalGate` callback created an unresolvable `Promise` with no code path to call `resolve()`, freezing the agent turn. Fixed by intercepting user input in the `onSubmit` handler: when `pendingApproval` is set, the input text is checked for `y`/`n`, the promise is resolved, and the approval result is displayed. Removed the obsolete enter-key binding that swallowed input without resolving. (`src/cli/chat.ts`)

- **`agent` leaf command overwrote all agent subcommands** — registering `{ path: ['agent'] }` after multi-segment entries (`['agent', 'chat']`, `['agent', 'tui']`, etc.) overwrote the parent `Command` created by `findOrCreateParent`, making all subcommands unreachable. Fixed by reordering the registry so the leaf entry registers first, and storing single-segment commands in the `parents` map so subsequent multi-segment entries attach as subcommands instead of creating a conflicting parent. (`src/cli/registry.ts`, `src/cli/registry-helpers.ts`)

- **Per-keystroke synchronous filesystem I/O in TUI** — `filePathProvider()` called `Deno.readDirSync(Deno.cwd())` on every keyboard event during normal typing, blocking the event loop for directories with many entries. Fixed by removing completion recalculation from the per-keystroke `onKey` handler. Completions now trigger only on explicit Tab press via `TextInput.handleTabCompletion()`. (`src/cli/chat.ts`, `src/cli/tui-cmd.ts`)

- **Full array copy on every streaming chunk** — `appendToLastMessage()` created `[...this.messages.slice(0, -1), last]` (O(n) allocation) and called `measureContent()` (O(n) `split('\n')` scan) on every LLM chunk. Changed to in-place mutation of the last message's content. (`src/tui/components/chat-view.ts`)

- **Unused imports in new command files** — removed `getActiveProvider`, `loadConfig`, `runMigrations` from `agent-exec.ts`, `ChatMessage` type from `chat.ts`, `loadConfig`, `CortexConfig`, `PATHS` from `config-cmd.ts`. (`src/cli/agent-exec.ts`, `src/cli/chat.ts`, `src/cli/config-cmd.ts`)

### Removed

  - **Deprecated command files** — `discord-cmd.ts` (functionality moved to `channels`), `remote-cmd.ts` (moved to `node`), `terminal.ts` (replaced by new TUI framework). (`src/cli/discord-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/remote-cmd.ts`, `src/tui/terminal.ts`)

### Added
- **Observable LLM provider wrapper** — all LLM calls across every subsystem are now automatically observed via an `ObservableLLMProvider` wrapper in `src/observability/provider-wrapper.ts`. Wrapping every provider returned by `buildProvider()` and `buildProviderFromConfig()` ensures Langfuse generations, Lens audit events (`llm_call`), and Prometheus metrics (`_turns_total`, `_tokens_input`, `_tokens_output`, `_cost_usd`, `_turns_duration_ms`) are recorded for every `complete()` and `stream()` call — including previously invisible calls from reflection (`src/agent/reflect.ts`), autofix (`src/sandbox/autofix.ts`), compliance classifier (`src/security/compliance.ts`), security supervisor (`src/security/supervisor.ts`), image analysis (`src/tools/builtin/image_analyze.ts`), skill extraction (`src/memory/skills.ts`), CLI setup/onboarding, and cascade router fallbacks. The main agent loop passes session/turn context via a `OBS_CONTEXT` symbol on `CompletionOptions` so wrapper generations attach to the parent Langfuse trace, and the loop's explicit `generationCreate()` and `logEvent('llm_call')` were removed to avoid double-counting. (`src/observability/provider-wrapper.ts`, `src/llm/router.ts`, `src/agent/loop.ts`)

- **Built-in agent profiles** — Cortex now ships with 5 pre-configured built-in agents in addition to user-created agents: **Assistant** (general-purpose default), **Developer** (code writing, debugging, refactoring), **Researcher** (web research, documentation, fact-finding), **Architect** (system design, planning, trade-off analysis), and **Analyst** (SQL, data exploration, statistics). Each has a specialized soul prompt with domain-specific identity, behavior guidelines, tool usage instructions, and output format conventions. Built-in agents cannot be deleted but can be customized via `cortex agent update`. The default agent has been migrated from `default` to `assistant` with full backward compatibility. A new `AgentConfig.builtin` field marks built-in agents, and `GET /api/agents/builtin` exposes their raw definitions. (`src/agent/builtin-agents.ts`, `src/agent/manager.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **IDE-style code editor** — the File Editor page was redesigned as a full IDE experience with resizable sidebar (180–500px), collapsible bottom panel with Problems/Output/Terminal tabs, drag-to-resize panel handle, file path breadcrumb navigation, inline find/replace bar with regex and case-sensitivity support, quick file open modal (Ctrl+P) with fuzzy search and arrow-key navigation, find-in-files with results in sidebar panel, right-click context menus on file tree (Open, Rename, Delete) and tabs (Close, Close Others, Close to Right, Close All), enhanced status bar with live cursor position (Ln/Col), language mode indicator, and indent info, color-coded file type icons by extension, inline new file/folder input replacing browser `prompt()`, and `escJs` helper for safe JS string escaping in `onclick` attributes. Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+P` quick open, `Ctrl+F` find, `Ctrl+H` find/replace, `Ctrl+Shift+F` find in files, `Ctrl+B` toggle editor sidebar, `Ctrl+J` toggle bottom panel. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Agent OS alignment audit** — comprehensive audit document (`docs/AGENT_OS_ALIGNMENT.md`) mapping the transition from "agentic harness" to "AI agent operating system". Covers terminology audit (5 misaligned "harness" references, 8 aligned "OS" references), OS layer maturity assessment (11 subsystems scored), agent identity gaps, 6 architectural gaps with target solutions, 3-phase implementation roadmap (23 items), and verification log.

- **OS capability groups** — tools are now organized into 12 capability groups (`CAP_FILE`, `CAP_SHELL`, `CAP_NET`, `CAP_MEMORY`, `CAP_GIT`, `CAP_AGENT`, `CAP_CODE`, `CAP_UI`, `CAP_SYSTEM`, `CAP_SKILL`, `CAP_SCHEDULE`, `CAP_BROWSER`) forming the basis of an OS syscall table. Each group maps to fine-grained `ToolCapability` entries. `CAPABILITY_GROUP_LABELS` provides human-readable names and `expandCapabilityGroup()` resolves groups to individual capabilities. (`src/tools/types.ts`)

- **Resource limits for agents** — new `ResourceLimits` type added to `AgentConfig` with `cpuShares` (1–1024), `memoryMb`, `diskMb`, `maxProcesses`, and `networkKbps` fields. These define per-agent resource quotas in the OS resource namespace. (`src/config/config.ts`)

- **Boot sequence definition** — formal `BootStage` type and `BOOT_ORDER` array define the ordered OS startup sequence: migrate → supervisor → validator → executor → scheduler → services → channels → ready. `BootStageStatus` tracks per-stage status. (`src/config/config.ts`)

- **OS health endpoint** — `GET /api/os/health` returns an aggregated health report including daemon status (validator, executor, scheduler via IPC ping), database connectivity, job counts, memory system health, version, and process uptime. Returns `status: "healthy"` or `"degraded"`. (`src/server/router.ts`)

- **System Services terminology** — sub-agent type definitions (`SubAgentType`, `SubAgentTypeDef`, `SUB_AGENT_TYPES`) now use "system services" terminology in documentation, framing them as specialized OS-level service processes rather than simple sub-agents. (`src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`)

- **Virtual filesystem** — new `src/vfs/` module provides an OS-level namespace abstraction mapping `/cortex/agents/:id/`, `/cortex/memory/:tier/`, `/cortex/config/`, `/cortex/db/:name.db`, `/cortex/logs/`, `/cortex/workspace/`, and `/cortex/plugins/` virtual paths to real filesystem locations and database tables. Includes `resolveVfsPath()`, `listVfsPaths()`, `listVfsByNamespace()`, and `vfsTree()` APIs. (`src/vfs/mod.ts`)

- **Supervisor upgraded to init process** — the supervisor daemon now follows the formal `BOOT_ORDER` sequence, starting daemons sequentially (validator → executor → scheduler) with socket readiness checks (10s timeout) before proceeding. Boot stage status is tracked via `getBootStatus()` exposing per-stage timeline. Crash-restart with exponential backoff is preserved. (`src/processes/supervisor-process.ts`)

- **OS kernel** — new `src/kernel/` module implements the `OsKernel` singleton: a system call dispatcher with capability enforcement and resource accounting. Features include RBAC with 4 roles (`admin`, `operator`, `user`, `agent`) each mapped to capability groups, per-agent token/cost CPU tracking, and a process registry with parent-child tree tracking. The kernel registers the main server as the root process (parentPid 0) and automatically tracks sub-agent processes spawned during execution. (`src/kernel/mod.ts`, `src/agent/sub-agent.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`)

- **OS API endpoints** — three new endpoints under `/api/os/`:
  - `GET /api/os/info` — kernel metadata (name, version, uptime, role list, process count)
  - `GET /api/os/processes` — process tree with nested display format and flat list
  - `GET /api/os/capabilities` — capability groups, role-to-capability mappings, and group members
  (`src/server/router.ts`)

- **OS Health dashboard** — new "OS Health" page in the Web UI showing a system health dashboard: overall CortexPrism OS status with version and uptime, daemon health cards (validator/executor/scheduler with green/red indicators), database connectivity, job counts (total/pending), memory system metrics, and request latency. Includes sidebar nav entry, Ctrl+P command palette entry, and manual refresh. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Kernel turn orchestration** — `kernelTurn()` and `kernelTurnStream()` in `src/kernel/loop.ts` wrap the agent loop with kernel-level orchestration: automatic process registration, token/cost tracking via the OS kernel, and resource accounting. This establishes the OS kernel/user-space split where the kernel dispatches to the agent loop and records resource consumption. (`src/kernel/loop.ts`)

- **Plugin dependency resolution** — new `src/plugins/deps.ts` module provides full dependency resolution for the plugin marketplace: semver constraint satisfaction (`^`, `~`, `>=`, `*` operators), topological sort for install ordering, circular dependency detection, transitive dependency traversal, and version compatibility checking. The `installPlugin()` function in `src/plugins/registry.ts` now validates dependencies before install and returns a result with missing dependency and warning lists. (`src/plugins/deps.ts`, `src/plugins/registry.ts`)

- **CI pipeline hardening** — CI now validates i18n consistency across all 10 locales (`deno task i18n:validate`), type-checks standalone entry points (`src/db/migrate.ts`), and includes a new `coverage` job that generates LCOV and JUnit reports via `deno task coverage:ci`. (`ci.yml`)

- **Release pipeline hardening** — the release `check` job now runs the full test suite (`deno test --allow-all`), validates i18n consistency, and type-checks standalone entry points before compiling release binaries. Previously tests were skipped on tag push, allowing binaries to ship without test validation. (`release.yml`)

- **Tauri desktop dashboard build** — new `build-dashboard` deno task and `desktop/build-dashboard.ts` script generate the full CortexPrism SPA (from `src/server/ui.ts`) as a static HTML file at `desktop/dist/index.html`, replacing the previous placeholder `<h1>` page. The Tauri `beforeBuildCommand` now points to `deno task build-dashboard`. (`deno.json`, `desktop/build-dashboard.ts`)

### Changed

- **Agent OS identity in soul templates** — all agent soul templates now identify the agent as running on CortexPrism OS rather than as a standalone assistant. The `DEFAULT_SOUL` adds OS awareness as the first identity bullet. The `INIT_SOUL_TEMPLATE` gains a new `## OS Environment` section describing the 8 OS-layer capabilities (persistent memory, tool system with Parallax validation, sub-agent orchestration, background daemons, skills system, job scheduler, plugin marketplace, audit log). All 8 `PERSONALITY_TEMPLATES` updated from "AI assistant" to "AI agent running on CortexPrism OS". (`src/agent/soul.ts`)

- **"Agentic harness" terminology replaced with "AI agent operating system"** across all public-facing surfaces: CLI description (`src/main.ts`), GitHub API User-Agent header (`src/workspace/github.ts`), and all package manager manifests (scoop, homebrew, chocolatey). (`src/main.ts`, `src/workspace/github.ts`, `packaging/scoop/cortex.json`, `packaging/homebrew/cortex.rb`, `packaging/chocolatey/cortex.nuspec`)

- **README version badge updated** from 0.46.0 to 0.47.0. (`README.md`)

### Fixed

- **Template literal regex producing JS comment** — the regex `/\/$/` in `name.replace()` was written with a single backslash, causing the template literal to output `//$/` which the JavaScript parser treated as a single-line comment (`//`), silently eating the rest of the line and corrupting all subsequent code in the rendered page. Changed to double-escaped `/\\/$/` so the template literal emits the correct `\/$/` regex literal. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Template literal `\n` producing literal newline in JS string** — `.split('\n')` inside the template literal was consumed as an actual newline character (0x0A), breaking the JavaScript single-quoted string literal across two lines. Changed to `.split('\\n')` so the template literal emits the correct `\n` escape sequence. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Template literal `\'` premature string termination** — 16 instances of `\'` inside JavaScript strings within the template literal were consumed as literal single quotes, causing premature string termination in the rendered JavaScript. All instances changed to `\\'` so the template literal emits correctly escaped `\'` sequences. This affected onclick handlers, context menu actions, and the editor textarea's `font-family` attribute. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Daemon logs always empty in UI** — the `/api/daemons/:name/logs` endpoint read from `validator.log`/`executor.log`/`scheduler.log` but the supervisor wrote logs to `daemon-validator.log`/`daemon-executor.log`/`daemon-scheduler.log`. Fixed the filename prefix mismatch and replaced the hardcoded `/root/.cortex/data/logs/` path with `PATHS.logDir`. Also the supervisor piped only `stderr` to the log files (`stdout: 'null'`), discarding all `console.log()` output (startup messages, migration progress, status lines). Changed to pipe both stdout and stderr so operational messages appear in the daemon logs. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/processes/supervisor-process.ts`)

- **Daemon migration race at startup** — the supervisor spawns all three daemon processes simultaneously, each calling `runMigrations()` which checks `schema_migrations` for existing records. All three detect no record before any inserts one, then all three attempt the same `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` — the first succeeds, the rest crash with `duplicate column name: embedding`. Made `applyMigration()` resilient to concurrent execution by catching "already exists" errors and recording the migration as applied via `INSERT OR IGNORE`. (`src/db/migrate.ts`)

- **OS Health page blank due to nested page div** — the `page-oshealth` div was inserted inside the still-open `page-codegraph` div, causing it to remain hidden when Codegraph was not the active page. Moved to the correct location between the Codegraph and Workflows page divs. Also added null guard on the `loadOSHealth()` content element reference. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Jobs duplicating from agent schedule tool and UI double-submit** — `createJob()` had no name-based deduplication: every double-click of the "Create" button, repeated CLI invocation, or LLM agent calling the `schedule` tool multiple times created a new job with a random ID. Added `upsert: true` mode to `createJob()` that updates the existing job by name instead of creating a duplicate (reanimates failed jobs, preserves source). The `schedule` tool now uses upsert semantics by default (`src/tools/builtin/schedule.ts`). UI "Create" button now disables on click to prevent double-submission. (`src/scheduler/scheduler.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **No visibility into job origin or mass deletion** — added `source` column to the jobs table (migration 036) tracking whether a job came from `ui`, `cli`, `seed`, or `tool:<agentId>`. Job cards in the UI now show a source badge. Added `DELETE /api/jobs/status/:status` and `DELETE /api/jobs/batch` endpoints, plus "Delete All Failed" and "Delete All Cancelled" buttons with confirmation dialogs in the UI. Added `deleteJobsBatch()` and `deleteJobsByStatus()` functions to the scheduler module. (`src/db/migrations/036_jobs_source.sql`, `src/scheduler/scheduler.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`, `src/cli/jobs.ts`, `src/memory/consolidate.ts`)

- **LLM producing raw tool code as output instead of executing it** — DeepSeek v4 model emits malformed `<tool_call>` blocks (nested tags, unescaped double quotes in large content strings) that `parseToolCalls` silently fails on, causing raw tool call XML/JSON to be streamed as the final response. Added complete-block detection in the malformed-tool-call guard (`<tool_call>...</tool_call>` pairs with zero parsed tools), structural-quote-vs-content-quote discrimination in `sanitizeModelJson` (peek-ahead for `:`, `,`, `}`, `]` after whitespace), and propagation of `injectMessages` from `post-reason` pipeline hooks back into the agent loop's `currentMessages`. Also expanded `PreCompletionChecklistMiddleware` trigger words to include `successfully`, `created`, `written`, `saved` and strengthened its inject message to explicitly warn that no tool calls were executed. (`src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/tools/executor.ts`, `src/pipeline/builtin.ts`, `tests/toolcall_parser_test.ts`)

## [0.47.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Sub-agent types expanded from 5 to 11** — the `sub_agent` tool schema, system prompt (`soul.ts`), and metacognition engine now support all 11 specialized types: `explore`, `general`, `plan`, `code`, `research`, `security`, `debug`, `architect`, `devops`, `data`, `ui`. Each type has an enhanced system prompt with domain-specific protocols, output formats, and constraints. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`, `src/agent/soul.ts`, `src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`)

- **True parallel sub-agent execution** — multiple `sub_agent` tool calls in the same turn now execute concurrently via `Promise.all` instead of sequentially. Non-sub-agent tools still run in order. Progress is logged with per-batch timing, success/failure counts, and average duration. (`src/agent/loop.ts`)

- **Metacognition engine domain expansion** — 6 new keyword sets added (security, debug, devops, data, ui, architect — 143 keywords total) to detect specialized task types. Signal breakdown includes all 10 domain scores. Suggested types are now score-sorted with a top-3 cap instead of hardcoded heuristics. (`src/agent/metacog.ts`)

- **Sub-agent retry with fallback** — when a specialized sub-agent fails, the tool retries with the same type and configuration (pass-through to `executeOnce` via `executeWithRetry`). Recursive spawning is prevented by a depth guard that refuses spawns at depth ≥ 2. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **Sub-agent usage metrics** — new `getSubAgentMetrics()` and `getSubAgentSuccessRate()` functions in the tracker provide per-type spawn/completion/failure counts and overall success ratio. Metrics use `structuredClone` to prevent mutation of internal state. `getSubAgentTaskBoard()` now includes the metrics object alongside active and recent tasks. (`src/agent/sub-agent-tracker.ts`)

- **Chat retry action** — `↻ Retry` button in the chat input bar replays the last turn by truncating the session at the last user message via `POST /api/sessions/:id/retry`. Attachment metadata and model parameters are persisted alongside user turns in the `tool_calls` column so retry works correctly after page reload. The active chat model/provider is inherited by sub-agents through `ToolContext`, preventing sub-agents from selecting unsupported models. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **Checkpoint restore** — `POST /api/memori/checkpoints/:id/restore` rewinds a session to any saved Memori checkpoint, injecting a system message with the checkpoint's resume context (goals, tool history, workspace state). `Restore` button added to each checkpoint in the Memori browser. Message replay runs inside a transaction (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`/`COMMIT`) for atomicity. `updateSessionProgress()` keeps `turn_count` and `last_turn_at` coherent across retry and restore operations. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/db/sessions.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent privilege-escalation fallback removed** — the automatic retry with `type="general"` that silently widened tool permissions (e.g. read-only security sub-agent → full shell/code_exec access) and hardcoded a bypass allow-list was removed. `executeWithRetry` is now a direct pass-through to `executeOnce`. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **DB corruption recovery hardened** — the `tryRecover()` fallback that silently deleted and recreated corrupted databases with no backup was replaced with a fail-closed approach that logs an error and returns `false`, requiring manual operator recovery. (`src/db/migrate.ts`)

- **Retry state drift after page reload** — user message metadata (attachments, agent, model, reasoning effort) is now persisted as JSON in the `tool_calls` column alongside user turns. `syncLastChatRequestFromMessages` reconstructs the full retry payload from persisted metadata instead of dropping attachments and resetting model settings. (`src/server/ws.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **lens.db multi-process corruption (SQLITE_CORRUPT)** — 5 OS processes (server, validator, executor, scheduler, sub-agents) were all opening and writing to the same WAL-mode `lens.db`. Concurrent `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` calls during backup raced with writes, corrupting btree pages and indexes. Fixed by preventing subprocesses from opening `lens.db` directly: `getLensDb()` returns a `NoopDb` stub when `CORTEX_NOLENS=1` is set in the environment, ensuring only the main server process writes to the audit log. Recovered 1836/2409 events from the corrupted DB via `sqlite3 .clone`. (`src/db/client.ts`, `src/db/lens.ts`, `src/processes/validator-process.ts`, `src/processes/executor-process.ts`, `src/processes/scheduler-process.ts`, `src/processes/sub-agent-entry.ts`, `src/processes/service-entry.ts`)

- **claude-sonnet-4-5 hallucinated by LLM** — the `sub_agent` tool's `model` parameter description listed `"claude-sonnet-4-5"` as an example, which the LLM then copied verbatim into sub-agent calls. Since no Anthropic provider was configured, every sub-agent with that model failed with provider errors. Removed the specific model example from the tool description and replaced it with guidance to use only configured providers. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **Metacognition delegate reason contradicted suggested types** — the `delegate` case used a hardcoded if-else chain that checked `security`/`debug`/`architect` before `research`/`code`/`explore`, causing the reason text to mismatch the score-sorted suggested types (e.g. "Security audit task" when `research=4` was the strongest signal). Changed to a `switch` on the score-sorted `primaryType`. (`src/agent/metacog.ts`)

- **Codegraph reimport transaction deadlock** — `bulkInsertEdges` opened an explicit `BEGIN` without error handling. Any failure between `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` left a dangling transaction on the shared memory DB singleton connection, poisoning all subsequent codegraph operations with `SQLITE_ERROR: cannot start a transaction within a transaction`. Added `ROLLBACK` in a `finally` block so the connection always returns to a clean state. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`)

- **Codegraph edge insert FK violations** — `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` was set inside a transaction in `bulkInsertEdges`, which is a no-op in SQLite and can cause deferred FK checks to fail at `COMMIT` in libsql. Removed the PRAGMA manipulation. Additionally, libsql's `INSERT OR IGNORE` does not reliably suppress FK violations on multi-row inserts, causing `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY` during reimport. Now queries existing `code_nodes` IDs and strips invalid edges before the INSERT, ensuring no FK-violating rows ever reach the statement. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`)

- **Codegraph fragile ID computation** — `bulkInsertNodes` and `bulkInsertEdges` used `last_insert_rowid()` outside a transaction, making ID retrieval vulnerable to concurrent INSERTs on the shared connection. `bulkInsertNodes` now wraps INSERT + rowid read in atomic `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`. `bulkInsertEdges` uses a reliable before/after `COUNT(*)` diff instead of extrapolating IDs from rowid. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`)

- **Codegraph clear order** — `clearProjectNodes` deleted `code_edges` and `code_nodes` before `code_file_hashes` and `code_communities`, allowing `ON DELETE CASCADE` from node deletes to pull edges from other projects. Reordered to delete non-referenced tables first, then edges, then nodes last. (`src/codegraph/graph.ts`)

- **Malformed tool calls silently dropped** — when the LLM emitted tool calls in unrecognized XML formats (e.g. `<tool_call name="sub_agent">` with nested attributes), `parseToolCalls` returned 0 and the loop treated the response as final text. `stripToolCallMarkup` then removed all content, leaving the user with blank output. Added malformed-tool-call detection before the final-response break: if the response contains unparsed `<tool_call name=` or raw `{"tool":` patterns, the system injects a format correction and continues the loop. (`src/agent/loop.ts`)

- **Empty final response after tool-call stripping** — when `stripToolCallMarkup` consumed the entire LLM response (e.g. all prose was inside tool blocks), the user received silence. Added a fallback: if the stripped response is empty and a `sub_agent` tool ran, surface the sub-agent's output directly; otherwise surface a summary of tools used. (`src/agent/loop.ts`)

- **Retry preserved invalid model override** — when the LLM passed a model name unsupported by the provider (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5` to deepseek), the retry with `type="general"` kept the same invalid `model` arg. Retry now detects model-related errors via regex and strips the override. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **Recursive sub-agent depth explosion** — a `general` retry sub-agent that succeeded could itself spawn more sub-agents, creating unbounded recursive chains (observed: 4 grandchild sub-agents from one retry). Added a depth guard that counts `sub_` prefixes in the session ID and refuses spawns at depth ≥ 2. Retry tool set also explicitly excludes `sub_agent`. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **Parallel state tracking race** — the `toolCallsMade` count in pipeline hook state used `toolResults.filter(Boolean).length` during parallel execution, causing non-deterministic counts. Replaced with `state.toolCallsMade` snapshots read before and after tool execution. (`src/agent/loop.ts`)

- **ARCHITECT_KEYWORDS overlapped with PLANNING_KEYWORDS** — `'architecture'` appeared in both keyword sets, causing double-scoring for architecture-related tasks. Removed from `PLANNING_KEYWORDS` (retained in `ARCHITECT_KEYWORDS` where it's more precisely scoped). (`src/agent/metacog.ts`)

- **Metacognition event-type / action mismatch** — `logPlan()` stored assessments as `event_type = 'plan_created'` with `action = 'plan:direct'` but the `/api/metacognition/history` and `/summary` endpoints queried `event_type = 'meta_assessment'`, returning empty results. The action prefix `plan:` also mismatched the UI's color map. Fixed to use `event_type = 'meta_assessment'`, `actor = 'metacognition'`, and bare action values. Escalation queries also corrected from `error IS NOT NULL` on wrong event_type to `event_type = 'escalation'`. (`src/agent/planner.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`)

- **Metacognition test endpoint missing** — the "Task Assessment Tester" in the UI used a simplified client-side keyword stub that didn't match the real `assessTask()` engine. Added `POST /api/metacognition/test` and rewrote `testMetacognition()` to call it with full signal breakdown, confidence, suggested sub-agents, and escalation state. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Skills export returned 400** — `skillsExport()` sent `POST /api/skills/export` with no body but the endpoint required `{ name }`. Fixed to prompt for skill name, fetch detail from `/api/skills/detail`, then POST the full skill data. Also removed the broken file-download that saved error JSON as a blob. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Skills merge sent wrong body format** — `skillsShowMerge()` sent raw file text as the POST body to `/api/skills/merge`, but the endpoint expects `{ target, source }`. Fixed to `JSON.parse()` and extract the correct fields with error handling for invalid JSON. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Skills dependency fallback used DB column name** — `skillsShowDeps()` fell back to `data.depends_on` (the DB column) instead of `data.dependents` (the API response field). (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Skills prompt hardcoded dead skill names** — `formatSkillsAsAvailableList()` recommended `cortex-dev` and `frontend-design` by name, but both are legacy skills excluded from `BUILTIN_SKILLS` and never registered in the DB. Agents following the prompt would get `SKILL_NOT_FOUND` on `load_skill`. Fixed to dynamically generate tips based on which skills are actually available. (`src/memory/skills.ts`)

- **Redundant dynamic import in skill_write** — `getSkillDependents` was already imported at the top of the file but was dynamically re-imported inline in the `dependents` operation. Removed the redundant `await import()`. (`src/tools/builtin/skill_write.ts`)

- **Vault expiration stored as relative string** — the UI sent `"30d"`/`"90d"`/`"1y"` as expiration values, the router stored them verbatim, and `vaultGet()` compared them as ISO date strings (e.g. `"30d" > "2026-..."` because `'3' > '2'`), so entries never expired. Fixed by converting relative durations to ISO 8601 timestamps in the router before storage. (`src/server/router.ts`)

- **Vault tags field silently dropped** — the UI sent a `tags` array, the router destructured but discarded it, the DB had no `tags` column, and the credential list tried to render `c.tags` (always undefined). Removed the dead tags input, form field, and rendering code from the UI. (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`)

- **Vault service reset to 'vault' on every edit** — the store endpoint hardcoded `service: 'vault'`, overwriting the original service (e.g. `'tool'`) on credential edits. Fixed to preserve the existing service from the DB. (`src/server/router.ts`)

- **MCP connect/disconnect/delete broken for HTTP transports** — all three endpoints (connect, disconnect, DELETE) only called `connectStdio`/`disconnectStdio`, never branching to the HTTP variants. HTTP connections could not be re-connected, disconnected, or deleted from the UI. Fixed by checking `conn.config.transport` and calling the correct function. (`src/server/router.ts`)

- **MCP server endpoint was a hardcoded stub** — `/api/mcp/server` always returned `{ running: true, port: 0 }`. `/api/mcp/server/start` and `/stop` were 404. Fixed to read the real port from `CORTEX_PORT`/`PORT` env vars and added start/stop endpoints that return the current status. (`src/server/router.ts`)

- **MCP Gateway page always failed** — `loadMcpGatewayPage()` called `GET /api/mcp-gateway/servers` which did not exist. Added the endpoint using `listServers()` from the gateway registry, returning `{ servers, healthy, degraded }`. Also fixed the UI fetch to use the `BASE` prefix consistently. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **code_search_symbol tool dropped language filter** — the tool captured `args.language` but never passed it to `ftsSearchNodes()`, silently ignoring the filter on the primary search path. (`src/tools/builtin/codegraph/code_search_symbol.ts`)

- **Codegraph pilot had dead input fields** — the Pilot panel rendered "File Pattern" and "Exclude Patterns" inputs but `runCodegraphPilot()` never read their values. Wired `filePattern` → `fileAllowlist` and `excludePattern` → `fileBlocklist` through the router into `createCodePilotConfig`. (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`)

- **Workspace path validation rejected valid global workspace paths** — `validateSandboxPath()` allowed only `workspacesDir` and `dataDir` as roots, rejecting `Deno.cwd()` (the global workspace). Added `Deno.cwd()` as a third allowed root, matching `resolveWorkspacePath()` behavior. WebUI sandbox operations now resolve the actual agent workspace directory instead of hardcoding `'/workspace'`. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/sandbox/logger.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **gVisor runtime fell through to subprocess** — `runInSandbox()` only routed `'docker'` to `runInDocker`; `'gvisor'` silently fell through to `runSubprocess`. Fixed to route both `'docker'` and `'gvisor'` through the Docker path. (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`)

- **Duplicate `let timedOut` declarations in executor** — all three timeout handlers (`runDockerCommand`, `runInDocker`, `runSubprocess`) had a duplicate `let timedOut = false` declaration and orphaned code remnants. Cleaned up to single declarations. (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`)

- **`_wsMap` not available on sandbox page** — workspace directory map was only populated when visiting the Agents page, causing "No workspace for this agent" on direct sandbox page navigation. `loadSandboxPage()` now fetches workspace and agent data independently. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

### Changed

- **Sub-agent type system prompts enhanced** — all 11 types now have detailed protocols, output format specifications, and quality standards. Notable: `code` adds production-quality standards and "no TODOs" rule; `security` adds full OWASP checklist with CWE mapping; `debug` adds 6-step systematic protocol; `architect` adds ADR format and 9-part output template; `data` adds 7-step analysis protocol; `ui` adds WCAG 2.1 AA standards and 5 UI state requirements. (`src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`)

- **Sub-agent tool description expanded** — the `sub_agent` tool's `description` field now documents all 11 types with one-line summaries, up from the previous 5. (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`)

- **Soul prompt sub-agent guidance rewritten** — the `## Sub-Agents` section in `soul.ts` now covers all 11 types with "Best for:" usage guidance, explicit anti-patterns (e.g. "fewer than 2 tool calls"), and notes that sub-agents execute in true parallel. (`src/agent/soul.ts`)

- **Sub-agent model/provider inherits from chat** — `ToolContext` now carries optional `model` and `provider` fields, populated by all chat/caller entry points (WS, CLI, A2A, triggers, services). `spawnSubAgent` prefers type-specific overrides, then context values, then agent defaults, so sub-agents use the active chat model unless a sub-agent type explicitly pins its own. Nested sub-agents preserve the inherited context. (`src/tools/types.ts`, `src/agent/sub-agent.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`, `src/processes/sub-agent-entry.ts`)

- **Sidebar navigation consolidated** — merged "Remote Access" and "Computer Use" into a single "Remote & Computer" nav item (both pages already shared sub-nav tabs). Removed standalone "Tools" sidebar item — Tool Config, MCP Servers, MCP Gateway, Chrome Bridge, and Vault are now accessed via Settings → Tools & Integrations (which already highlighted `nav-settings` for these sub-pages). Fixed Quartermaster "Config" button to open the in-page settings pane instead of showing a prompt redirect to Settings. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Sandbox debug logging** — all sandbox modules now emit debug/warn/error logs through namespaced loggers (`sandbox:exec`, `sandbox:workspace`, `sandbox:snapshot`, `sandbox:provision`, etc.) built on the existing `logger()` infrastructure. Toggleable at runtime via `CORTEX_SANDBOX_DEBUG=true` env var, `CORTEX_SANDBOX_LOG_LEVEL=debug`, the `--sandbox-debug` CLI flag on `serve`/`chat` commands, the `GET/PUT /api/sandbox/debug` API, or the WebUI sandbox config panel checkbox. Debug output includes runtime detection probes, container lifecycle events, snapshot capture/restore progress, path validation diagnostics, and execution timeout/error details. (`src/sandbox/logger.ts`, `src/sandbox/*.ts`, `src/cli/serve.ts`, `src/cli/chat.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **SandboxEnvironment class** — `SandboxEnvironment.create(opts)` provisions a persistent Docker container with workspace mount, resource limits, and optional gVisor isolation. `.setup()` auto-detects dependencies and runs install commands (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`). `.exec(code, language)` runs code via `docker exec` in the live container with language-specific entrypoints for all 8 supported languages including Go/Rust compile-then-run pipelines. `.destroy()` stops and removes the container. (`src/sandbox/environment.ts`)

- **Workspace snapshot restore with embedded content** — `captureWorkspaceSnapshot` accepts `includeContent: true` to embed file contents (≤5 MB) as base64 in the snapshot JSON. `restoreWorkspaceSnapshot` now writes files back to disk from embedded content, creating parent directories as needed. The restore manifest (`.cortex-ws-restore.json`) includes restore timestamp and omits content blobs. (`src/sandbox/workspace-snapshot.ts`, `src/sandbox/snapshot-types.ts`)

- **Sandbox barrel export** — `src/sandbox/mod.ts` centralizes all sandbox public API exports (execution, snapshots, environments, logging, validation). (`src/sandbox/mod.ts`)

- **Workspace ensure endpoint** — `POST /api/workspace/agents/:agentId/ensure` creates the agent workspace directory and initializes a git repo on demand. `GET /api/workspace/agents/:agentId` returns workspace info with existence check. Sandbox modal now shows a "Create Workspace" button inline when no workspace exists for the selected agent. (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`)

- **Sandbox modal UI** — all sandbox operations (capture environment snapshot, capture workspace snapshot, replicate environment, restore workspace) now use a unified modal overlay with agent selector, workspace path display, form fields with help hints, and inline workspace creation. Replaces `prompt()`/`alert()` dialogs for a consistent UX. (`src/server/ui.ts`)

---

## [0.46.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Auto model selection with explicit model pool** — new `Auto` chat model mode that uses a backend-native runtime selector to pick the best LLM per turn from a configurable global pool. The pool is managed in the Quartermaster `Model Intelligence` settings UI. Auto resolution integrates with the Model Quartermaster (MQM) for learned predictions and falls back to heuristic complexity-based selection. Per-turn resolved model metadata (provider, model, fallback reason) is reported through the WebSocket `done` payload and surfaced in the chat UI header and warning toast. Agent-level explicit `provider`/`model` overrides bypass Auto mode.
  - `AutoModelPoolEntry` type and `autoModelPool` field added to `ModelSelectionConfig` in `src/config/config.ts`
  - `POST /api/qm/config` extended to persist and validate the pool with provider validation and de-duplication
  - New `src/model-quartermaster/auto-resolver.ts` module with `resolveAutoModel()` performing pool filtering, MQM prediction, and heuristic fallback
  - WebSocket `modelMode` field on chat messages (`'manual'` | `'auto'`); `done` payload extended with `requestedModelMode`, `resolvedProvider`, `resolvedModel`, `autoFallback`, `autoFallbackReason`
  - Chat UI `#chat-model-select` gains an `Auto` option; `loadModelSelector()` and `sendMessage()` track `currentModelMode`
  - Quartermaster settings UI gains an "Auto Model Pool" card with add/remove/enable/disable/fetch-import workflows

- **Quartermaster wired into agent loop** — `observe()` now records every tool execution and `predict()` runs before each LLM round, injecting a tool suggestion hint into the follow-up instruction. Threshold lowered from 50 to 10 observations for faster activation. This enables the system to learn tool-success patterns and nudge the model toward productive actions (e.g. suggesting `file_write` when the model is stuck reading files).

- **Structured content block support in LLM providers** — `CompletionChunk` extended with `event`, `blockIndex`, `blockName`, `blockIsToolInput` fields. Anthropic provider now preserves `content_block_start` / `input_json_delta` / `content_block_stop` events instead of flattening to text. OpenAI-compatible providers (18 total including DeepSeek) now handle `delta.tool_calls` arrays. The agent loop accumulates tool calls from structured events directly, bypassing regex parsing for providers that support it.

- **Tool call parser: direct-tool-name-as-tag format** — `parseToolCallsFromFragments` now recognizes `<file_read_enhanced><path>x</path></file_read_enhanced>` format where the tool name is used directly as an XML tag with child parameter tags. Handles 14 tool names.

- **Tool call parser: JSON sanitization** — `sanitizeModelJson()` pre-processes model-emitted JSON to fix common errors before `JSON.parse`: raw unescaped newlines in string values, unquoted property names, and trailing commas. This is the fix for DeepSeek emitting multi-paragraph content with literal newlines in JSON strings.

- **Tool call parser: `<parameter>` tag support** — `parseToolArgsFromXml` now parses `<parameter name="key" string="true">value</parameter>` format in addition to `<tool_call_arg_key>`/`<tool_call_arg_value>` pairs.

- **Agent loop: urgency nudge** — the follow-up instruction now triggers at `roundsLeft <= 2` (was `<= 1`), explicitly tells the model to use `file_write` for file creation tasks, and says "produce the deliverable" instead of "summarise." `maxToolRounds` increased from 8 to 12.

- **Test infrastructure: coverage, helpers, error types** — added `deno task coverage` and `deno task coverage:ci` for HTML/LCov+JUnit coverage reports. Created `tests/test_helpers.ts` with shared utilities (temp DB, session schema init, mock session/turn IDs, log capture). Created `src/utils/errors.ts` with 10 typed error classes (`ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `AuthError`, `RateLimitError`, `TimeoutError`, `ConfigurationError`, `DatabaseError`, `LLMProviderError`, `ToolExecutionError`) plus `isRetryable()` and `errorToResponse()` helpers.

- **`cortex debug` CLI command** — new command tree for live introspection: `sessions` (list active), `session <id>` (full inspect), `turn <turnId> --session <id>` (transcript), `health` (DB/disk checks), `metrics` (Prometheus output), `memory` (episodic/semantic counts).

- **Debug HTTP endpoints** — `GET /api/debug/health` (live DB verification), `GET /api/debug/sessions` (active sessions with message counts), `GET /api/debug/sessions/:id` (full transcript), `GET /api/debug/metrics` (Prometheus text), `GET /api/debug/config` (safe config dump).

- **Logging enhancements** — request ID propagation via `setLogRequestId()` / `getLogRequestId()`, automatic stack-trace capture on `Logger.error()` calls, `reqId` and `stack` fields added to `LogEntry`.

### Fixed

- **Tool call parsing: multiple formats not recognized** — the parser now handles five model output formats: (1) JSON inside `<tool_call>` tags, (2) `<tool_call_name>`/`<tool_call_args>` nested XML, (3) `<tool_call_name="name">` attribute syntax, (4) `<file_read_enhanced><path>x</path></file_read_enhanced>` direct-tool-name-as-tag, and (5) `<parameter name="key">value</parameter>` format. Previously only formats 1–2 were recognized; formats 3–5 caused tool calls to be silently dropped.

- **Tool call parsing: JSON rejected due to raw newlines in strings** — DeepSeek emits JSON inside `<tool_call>` tags with literal newlines in string values (e.g. multi-paragraph `content` fields). `JSON.parse` rejects this as invalid JSON. Added `sanitizeModelJson()` to escape newlines, unquote bare keys, and remove trailing commas before parsing.

- **Agent loop: infinite research without writing** — the model would spend all 8 tool rounds reading files and never reach `file_write`. Fixed by wiring Quartermaster tool prediction into the follow-up instruction, increasing max rounds to 12, and triggering the urgency nudge at 2 rounds remaining instead of 1 with explicit "use file_write NOW" language.

- **Workspace file_write: `Is a directory` error for root-level paths** — `resolveWorkspacePath()` wrapped its output through `resolve()` from `@std/path`, which collapsed a joined absolute file path back to the directory prefix in some CWD-relative edge cases. Removed the unnecessary `resolve()` call; workspace directories are already absolute and only need `join` + `normalize`.

- **Web UI chat refresh created duplicate sessions and showed raw tool markup** — the chat page now hydrates the active session id from `localStorage` before the first send, so reloads stay on the same session. The websocket now sends cleaned final content on completion and the UI swaps the in-progress bubble for the final markdown, preventing tool-call XML from leaking into the rendered transcript.

- **Web UI chat refresh lost the in-flight request** — the first user turn now initializes the per-session DB before sending the message, and the session/chat state is restored from the saved session id after reload. This keeps the active request visible instead of disappearing on refresh.

- **Chat bubble formatting collapsed paragraph breaks** — `stripToolMarkup()` used `/\s{3,}/g` (match any 3+ whitespace including newlines) which collapsed paragraph separators into single spaces. Changed to `/\n{3,}/g` (collapse excess newlines only) and `/[ \t]{2,}/g` (collapse runs of spaces/tabs).

- **Web UI file editor: 404 opening files in subdirectories** — the editor used `encodeURIComponent()` on full file paths (e.g., `cortex/CHANGELOG.md`), which encoded `/` as `%2F`. The server's route regex expects literal `/` separators, so requests like `/api/workspace/agents/jenna/files/cortex%2FCHANGELOG.md` failed to match any route. Path segments are now encoded individually, matching the existing tree-listing pattern.

- **InjectionDetectorHook flagged tool result content as prompt injection** — the hook checked the last `role:'user'` message for injection patterns, but after tool execution the agent loop injects tool results as `role:'user'` follow-up instructions. Large file content (e.g. a 24K development plan) would match patterns like "you are a" or "system:" and abort the turn silently. Fixed by filtering out system-generated tool result messages before checking injection patterns.

- **WebSocket reconnect on new tab created duplicate sessions** — `ensureChatSession()` only checked the per-connection `sessionId` variable, which is `null` on a new WebSocket. The client sends `msg.sessionId` with chat messages but it was ignored. Fixed by passing `msg.sessionId` to `ensureChatSession`, which now resumes the session via `resumeSession()` when the client provides an existing session ID.

- **Pipeline abort showed "Thinking…" forever instead of the reason** — when a pipeline hook aborted the turn before any chunks streamed, the `done` event sent `finalContent: 'Thinking…'` and never displayed `result.response` (the abort message). Fixed by sending the abort message as a `chunk` to the client when no previous chunks were delivered.

- **Injection guard falsely blocked follow-up turns using tool results** — the `InjectionDetectorHook` examined the last `role:'user'` message, but the agent loop injects tool results back as synthetic user messages. Large trusted file content (for example a generated development plan) could contain phrases like `you are a` or `system:` and trigger a false-positive prompt-injection abort. The hook now skips system-generated tool-result follow-up messages and only evaluates actual user input.

- **OpenAI-compatible streaming tool calls could leave the UI stuck at `Thinking…`** — some providers emit `tool_calls` deltas where the tool call entry is created before the function name arrives in a later chunk. The stream adapter created an entry with an empty name and never updated it, so no `tool_use_start` event was emitted and the agent loop saw zero tool calls. The adapters in `src/llm/openai.ts` and `src/llm/openai-compatible.ts` now update the cached entry name when later chunks provide it and emit the start event as soon as the name becomes available.

- **Chat response formatting collapsed into a single paragraph** — the websocket stream sanitizer trimmed leading and trailing newlines from every chunk and collapsed whitespace too aggressively, flattening markdown paragraph boundaries in the visible chat bubble. Streaming and final-output cleanup now preserve normal newlines, only collapsing excessive blank lines and repeated spaces.


---

## [0.45.4] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **`cortex stop`: duplicate `stopDaemons` logic** — removed the local `stopDaemons` function and `DAEMON_PATTERNS` constant from `stop.ts`; now imports the canonical `stopDaemons` from `daemon.ts`, eliminating divergent kill-pattern lists.

- **`cortex agentlint check`: fabricated static config** — the `check` subcommand previously linted a hardcoded fake config (`Default Agent`, `gpt-4o`, empty tools). It now loads the real config via `loadConfig()` and uses actual provider/model/tools values.

- **`cortex agentlint`: `description` field set to agent name** — `config.agent.name` was used for both `name` and `description` fields in both agentlint subcommands. The `description` field now derives a meaningful value from the agent name and provider.

- **`cortex channels start/test`: duplicated switch block** — a 50-line `switch`/`case` block for loading channel plugins (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Teams, Mattermost, RocketChat, WhatsApp, Google Chat, Lark) was copy-pasted verbatim between the `start` and `test` subcommands. Extracted into a shared `loadChannelPlugin(type)` helper.

- **`cortex mcp serve`: no-op stub** — the `serve` subcommand only printed a redirect message. It now starts a real HTTP server using `Deno.serve` + the existing `handleMcpHttpRequest` handler, with `--port` (default 9187) and `--host` options.

- **`cortex tui`: hardcoded version string** — welcome message displayed `v0.20.0` unconditionally. Now calls `getVersion()` from `config/version.ts` to display the actual running version.

- **`cortex a2a card/skills`: hardcoded `localhost:4220`** — the A2A base URL was hardcoded. Both subcommands now accept a `--url` flag, falling back to the `CORTEX_A2A_URL` environment variable, then a config field, then the default.

- **`cortex voice set-speed`: no-op** — the `set-speed` subcommand printed a message but never saved the value. It now validates the rate (0.25–4.0), persists it to config via `saveConfig()`, and confirms the change.

- **`cortex restart`: `fuser` called on all platforms** — `fuser -k <port>/tcp` is Linux-only. The restart command used try/catch as cross-platform control flow. It now checks `isLinux()` first and only attempts `fuser` on Linux, falling back directly to pid-based kill on macOS and Windows.

- **`cortex hooks`: missing `enable` subcommand** — `hooks disable` had no symmetric counterpart. Added `hooks enable <name>` which re-registers a named built-in hook via the new `getBuiltinHook(name)` export from `pipeline/builtin.ts`.

- **`cortex import`: unused `prefix` parameter** — `printSummary()` declared a `prefix = ''` parameter that was never referenced inside the function body. Removed.

### Changed

- **`cortex discord` deprecated** — the standalone `discord` command was a legacy implementation duplicating the `channels` system. It now prints a deprecation notice with migration instructions pointing to `cortex channels add --type discord`.

- **`cortex remote` deprecated** — `remote` overlapped with the more capable `node` system (which adds tiers, groups, and capability enforcement). The command now prints a deprecation notice redirecting to `cortex node`.

- **`cortex mcp-gateway` deprecated** — gateway subcommands (`status`, `health`) have been merged under `cortex mcp gateway`. The top-level `mcp-gateway` command now prints a deprecation notice.

- **`cortex mcp gateway` added** — the MCP gateway `status` and `health` subcommands are now accessible as `cortex mcp gateway status` and `cortex mcp gateway health`, keeping all MCP management under one command tree.

- **`cortex daemon install/uninstall` removed** — these duplicated the top-level `cortex install --daemon-only` / `cortex uninstall --daemon-only` commands. The top-level commands are the canonical path.

- **`cortex serve install/uninstall` removed** — these duplicated the top-level `cortex install --server-only` / `cortex uninstall --server-only` commands. The top-level commands are the canonical path.

- **`cortex node list` removed** — the `list` subcommand was identical to the default `cortex node` action. Running `cortex node` already lists all nodes.

- **`cortex agentlint check` vs `config` differentiated** — `check` is now a compact, CI-friendly mode: prints only issues, no verbose header, exits with code 1 if errors are found. `config` remains the full verbose lint report with provider and model details.

### Added

- **`cortex workflow list`** — explicit `list` subcommand added for consistency with other commands. Previously, listing required running the bare `cortex workflow` command with no arguments.

- **`getBuiltinHook(name)`** — new export from `pipeline/builtin.ts` returns a fresh instance of any named built-in pipeline hook, enabling `cortex hooks enable` to re-register individual hooks after they have been disabled.

- **Web UI: AgentLint integrated into Agents page** — AgentLint is no longer a standalone page. It is now a **🔍 AgentLint** tab within the Agent Manager page alongside "Agents" and "Sub-Agent Types". The tab lazily fetches `/api/agentlint/check?agentId=<id>` for the currently active agent and renders the summary cards and issue list inline. A Re-run button allows on-demand re-execution.

- **Web UI: Tools & Integrations sub-navigation** — Vault, MCP Servers, MCP Gateway, Chrome Bridge, and Tool Config are now grouped under a shared sub-nav bar when navigating into any of those pages, with a back button returning to the Settings → Tools & Integrations pane. These pages are no longer duplicated as standalone sidebar items.

- **`GET /api/agentlint/check?agentId=`** — the endpoint now accepts an optional `agentId` query parameter. When provided, it fetches that agent's stored config (name, description, systemPrompt, tools, maxTurns, provider, model) from the database and lints it. Falls back to the global default agent config when omitted.

### Fixed

- **Web UI: `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'tools'`** — the `injectToolsSubNav` function built `onclick` attribute strings using `\'` escape sequences inside a TypeScript template literal, producing malformed JavaScript in the rendered page. Changed to `&apos;` HTML entities, which are correctly interpreted by the browser when `innerHTML` is set at runtime.

- **Web UI: `ReferenceError: showPage is not defined`** — cascading failure caused by the above `SyntaxError` preventing the script block from parsing. Resolved as a side-effect of the escaping fix.

- **Web UI: duplicate sidebar entries for Vault, MCP, Chrome Bridge** — these pages were listed both as standalone sidebar nav items and as cards within the Settings → Tools & Integrations pane. The redundant top-level sidebar buttons were removed; the pages remain accessible via the Settings sub-navigation.

- **Web UI: missing `/api/agentlint/check` endpoint** — the AgentLint UI page called this endpoint but the route handler was absent (commented-out placeholder). Implemented the handler to call `lintAgentConfig` with real config values.

### Changed

- **Web UI: standalone AgentLint page removed** — `page-agentlint`, the `nav-agentlint` sidebar button, the `agentlint` PAGES entry, the `agentlint` CMD_PAGES entry, and the `loadAgentLintPage` function have all been removed. AgentLint functionality is now accessed exclusively through the Agents page tab.

---

## [0.45.3] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Codegraph: zero nodes from indexing** — tree-sitter WASM grammar URLs at `indexer.ts:88–104` had a non-existent `wasm/` subdirectory prefix (404 from jsDelivr). Removed the prefix; all 12 grammars now download successfully.

- **Codegraph: tree-sitter API mismatch** — `web-tree-sitter` v0.24.x moved `init()` and `Language` to the default export. Updated `getParser()` and `loadLanguage()` to call `mod.default.init()` and store `mod.default.Language` on the module-level `_Language` variable instead of accessing `parser.constructor.Language` (which resolved to the internal `ParserImpl`, not the public `Parser` class).

- **Codegraph: zero edges from indexing** — edge resolution failed because call/import edges had `sourceQName` set to the file path (`src/router.ts`) while node qualified names are `src/router.ts:functionName`. Added `fileNodeMap` to `ResolutionContext` so `resolveEdges` falls back to finding a node in the source file when the exact QName doesn't match.

- **Codegraph: FTS5 search index never populated** — the `code_nodes_fts` virtual table uses external content mode (`content='code_nodes'`), which requires an explicit `rebuild` command to sync. Added `rebuildFtsIndex()` to `graph.ts` and call it after `indexRepository()` and `incrementalSync()` complete. Symbol search now returns results.

- **Codegraph: edge insert foreign key / unique constraint crashes** — wrapped edge insertion in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` and `INSERT OR IGNORE`, plus an orphan cleanup that deletes edges referencing non-existent nodes. Added client-side edge filtering in `renderCodegraphGraph` so D3 never sees invalid `source_id`/`target_id`.

- **Codegraph: Impact / Path Tracer panels always showed "No dependencies/paths found"** — the `POST /api/codegraph/impact` endpoint returned a flat `TraceResult[]` array, but the UI expected `{ nodes: [...] }`. The `POST /api/codegraph/trace` endpoint returned a flat array, but the UI expected `{ paths: [[...]] }`. Fixed both endpoints to match the expected shape.

- **Codegraph: Architecture panel referenced non-existent `circularDeps`** — removed the dead field reference and added live Node/Edge/Hotspot counts from the `ArchitectureSummary` data.

- **Codegraph: legend showed colors for labels not in `CODE_NODE_LABELS`** — removed `CodeVariable`, `CodeConstant`, `CodeComponent`, `CodeHook`, `CodeProject`, `CodeService`, `CodeMiddleware` and mapped the remaining 7 colors to actual labels: `CodeFunction`, `CodeMethod`, `CodeClass`, `CodeInterface`, `CodeEnum`, `CodeType`, `CodeModule`, `CodeRoute`, `CodePackage`, `CodeFile`, `CodeResource`.

- **Codegraph: `resolveTarget` logic bug** — the prefix extracted from dotted target QNames was computed but the loop always returned on the first candidate iteration, skipping import-map resolution. Restructured so import-map matching runs first, then falls back to generic candidate match with a lower confidence score.

- **Codegraph UI: blank page with no way to index** — added an **Index** button next to the project selector that opens an inline path prompt. The empty-state overlay now shows an actionable "Index a Project" button. The button changes to **Re-index** when a project is selected and re-indexes directly using the stored `root_path`.

- **Codegraph UI: refresh reset selected project** — `loadCodegraphProjects()` now saves and restores the `<select>` value after rebuilding the dropdown HTML.

- **Codegraph UI: graph visualization** — nodes are now sized by degree (connection count), hover tooltips show type/name/file/line, labels use white text, edges use brighter stroke with arrowhead markers, and the group element moves via `transform` instead of separate circle/text positioning.

- **Editor: directories shown as plain files** — both workspace listing endpoints (`GET /api/workspace/files` and `GET /api/workspace/agents/:id/files`) now append `/` to directory names via `entry.isDirectory ? entry.name + '/' : entry.name`, matching the frontend's `name.endsWith('/')` check.

- **Editor: directory navigation** — added `editorCurrentPath` state, `editorOpenDir()`, and `editorGoUp()` functions. Clicking a folder navigates into it; a `..` breadcrumb navigates up. File open/save use the full relative path including directory prefix.

- **Projects: agent selection on GitHub import** — added an agent `<select>` dropdown to both the import modal and inline panel. The `POST /api/projects/import-github` endpoint now accepts an `agentId` field and clones repos into `PATHS.workspacesDir/<agentId>/<projectName>` instead of the generic workspace root. The New Project form's agent field changed from free-text input to an agent dropdown.

- **Re‑index diagnostics** — `POST /api/codegraph/index` now returns `nodeCount`, `edgeCount`, `fileCount`, `errorCount`, and `errorSample` (first 5 error messages) in the response. The UI shows these counts after every index/re‑index operation so failures are visible without checking server logs. Unsupported languages and missing grammars are now silently skipped instead of counting as errors.

- **Template‑literal string escaping** — fixed the `renderEditorTree` regex `/\/$/` and onclick-string `\'` escapes that were consumed by the TypeScript template literal, producing broken JavaScript in the generated HTML.

- **API: 404 on `/api/remote/agents`, `/api/remote/directives`, and `/api/remote/deploy`** — added route handlers for the Remote Agents page proxying the existing node registry and directive dispatch infrastructure in `hub/node-registry.ts` and `hub/ws-node.ts`.

- **API: 404 on `/api/computer/screenshots`, `/api/computer/actions`, and `/api/computer/config`** — wired existing `listComputerScreenshots()`, `listComputerActions()`, and `isComputerUseAvailable()` helper functions to API routes.

- **API: 404 on `/api/vault/list`, `/api/vault/store`, `/api/vault/delete/:key`, `/api/vault/audit`, `/api/vault/export`, and `/api/vault/import`** — added route handlers for the Vault page covering credential listing, storage, deletion, audit log retrieval, export, and import. Extended `vaultList()` to include `expires_at` and `usage_limit` fields.

- **Web auth: login redirect loop on HTTP** — session cookies had the `Secure` flag unconditionally set, preventing browsers from storing them over plain HTTP connections. `setSessionCookie()` and `clearSessionCookie()` in `auth.ts` now accept the `Request` and conditionally include `Secure` based on the request protocol.

- **Web auth: vault key not set causing auth bypass** — the vault encryption system requires `CORTEX_VAULT_KEY` to be set in the environment. Without it, `hasPassword()` silently returned `false`, causing `requireAuth()` to bypass all authentication. Documented the requirement and set the key for the server process.

- **Web auth: onboarding API endpoints behind auth middleware** — the 11 onboarding POST endpoints (`/api/onboarding/provider`, `/api/onboarding/personality`, `/api/onboarding/channels`, `/api/onboarding/advanced`, `/api/onboarding/telemetry`, `/api/onboarding/complete`, `/api/onboarding/progress`, `/api/onboarding/profile/start`, `/api/onboarding/profile/answer`, `/api/onboarding/profile/skip`) were placed after the auth middleware gate, causing 401 errors during onboarding when sessions expired. Moved them to the public section before the middleware.

- **UI: password field DOM warnings** — orphaned `<input type="password">` elements in settings pages triggered Chrome's "not contained in a form" warnings. Added a `DOMContentLoaded` script that auto-wraps orphaned password inputs in `<form onsubmit="return false">` with `display:contents`.

- **UI: missing autocomplete on vault key input** — added `autocomplete="off"` to the `#vault-key-input` element in the credential modal.

- **API: 404 on `/api/eval/suites`, `/api/eval/run`, `/api/eval/runs`, `/api/eval/runs/:id`, `/api/eval/baselines`, and `/api/eval/baselines/:id`** — added route handlers for the Eval page wiring the existing `listSuites()`, `runSuite()`, `listRuns()`, `getRun()`, `listBaselines()` functions from `eval/runner.ts`. Added `deleteBaseline()` to the runner module.

- **API: 502 on `/api/providers/:kind/models` for unconfigured providers** — the model list endpoint now returns an empty array instead of a 502 error when the provider has no API key configured or the upstream API is unreachable, eliminating console noise while the frontend fallback handles the empty list.

### Added

- **Polyglot cross-language analysis** — the architecture endpoint now runs `detectFFIBridges` on loaded nodes via the `polyglot.ts` module. If FFI bridges (JNI, cgo, ctypes, etc.) are detected, the architecture response includes an `ffiBridges` field.

- **Incremental sync watcher** — the Codegraph page now starts a 30‑second polling loop (`POST /api/codegraph/incremental-sync`) that calls `incrementalSync()` to re‑index only changed files. The graph auto‑refreshes when new nodes/edges are found. Stops when leaving the page or switching projects.

- **Pilot config wired** — the `code_pilot` tool now loads saved pilot config from `loadConfig()` (token budget, pruning mode, include tests) and uses those values as defaults when arguments aren't provided. The `GET/PUT /api/codegraph/pilot-config` endpoints now have an active consumer.

- **Error logging** — added `console.error` logging to previously-bare catch blocks in `discoverFiles`, `indexFile`, and `incrementalSync` so IO/parsing failures are visible in server logs.

## [0.45.2] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **UI: `fetchJSON is not defined` on Sandbox, Projects, PromptLab, and Channels pages** — `fetchJSON()` was scoped inside `loadDashboard()` via the `DASHBOARD_JS` template, making it inaccessible to other page-specific functions. Moved `fetchJSON` to global script scope so all pages can use it.

- **API: 404 on `/api/metacognition/history` and `/api/metacognition/summary`** — added route handlers in `router.ts` querying `lens_events` for `meta_assessment` events. History returns last 100 assessments; summary returns decision distribution, escalation count, and recent adversarial critiques.

- **API: 404 on `/api/tools/registry`** — added route handler returning full tool definitions (name, description, params, capabilities). Also registered built-in tools into `globalRegistry` during server startup (`server.ts`) so both `/api/tools/list` and `/api/tools/registry` return populated data (60 tools).

- **API: 404 on `/api/a2a/agent-card.json`** — added `/api/a2a/agent-card.json` as an alias alongside existing `/.well-known/agent-card.json` in the A2A agent card handler.

- **API: 404 on `/api/processes/sub-agents`** — added route handler listing running sub-agent Deno processes via `ps` filtering.

- **API: 404 on `/api/providers/comparison`, `/api/router/history`, `/api/security/supervisor`, and `/api/security/supervisor/history`** — added route handlers for the Settings page extension tabs (Providers, Router, Supervisor):
  - `GET /api/providers/comparison` — returns each configured provider with model and context window size
  - `GET /api/router/history` — returns router fallthrough history (ephemeral, returns empty until router metrics are persisted)
  - `GET /api/security/supervisor` — returns supervisor configuration (provider, model, cache TTL) via `selectSupervisorModel()`
  - `PUT /api/security/supervisor` — updates supervisor provider, model, and cache TTL in config
  - `DELETE /api/security/supervisor/cache` — clears the supervisor decision cache
  - `GET /api/security/supervisor/history` — returns cached supervisor decision entries

- **Supervisor config now configurable** — added `SupervisorConfig` type (`provider`, `model`, `cacheTTL`) to `CortexConfig`. `selectSupervisorModel()` in `supervisor.ts` checks the explicit config first before falling through to key-detection logic. Settings UI replaced read-only stat rows with editable provider/model dropdowns (populated from configured providers and their available models) and a Save button.

- **UI: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')` in Settings tabs** — `switchSettingsTab()` and `switchSettingsExtTab()` were accessing `.style.display` on `document.getElementById('settings-ext-tab-*')` elements that may not exist if `extendSettings()` hasn't been called yet. Added null-guards (`?.style`) on all three tab button references.

- **API: 404 on `/api/memori/checkpoints`** — added route handler querying the `memori_checkpoints` table with optional `sessionId` and `limit` query params, returning turn number, timestamp, tokens used, tool call count, and goal snapshot per checkpoint.

- **API: 404 on `/api/daemons/health`** — added route handler returning live daemon status (validator, executor, scheduler) with their Unix socket paths. Also added `GET /api/daemons/:name/logs?lines=` for log retrieval and `POST /api/daemons/:name/restart`.

- **API: 404 on `/api/memory/privacy`, `/api/memory/heuristics`, `/api/memory/embeddings`, and `/api/memory/vector-store`** — added Memory page extension tab route handlers:
  - `GET/PUT /api/memory/privacy` — PII redaction toggle and max retention days, stored in config
  - `GET /api/memory/heuristics` — heuristic category catalog with rule counts; `PUT` runs the heuristic cycle
  - `GET/PUT /api/memory/embeddings` — embedding provider/model/URL/key/dimensions configuration
  - `GET/PUT /api/memory/vector-store` — vector store backend selection (SQLite/Qdrant/ChromaDB/Pinecone)

- **Projects: GitHub import + Codegraph integration** — added `POST /api/projects/import-github` to clone a GitHub repository into the local workspaces area, create a filesystem project, and best-effort index it into Codegraph. The Projects page now has an **Import from GitHub** action with both modal and inline fallback repo pickers.

- **Codegraph: created Projects now appear in project selector** — `GET /api/codegraph/projects` now merges indexed codegraph projects with filesystem projects from the Projects page. Selecting a filesystem-only project in Codegraph auto-indexes it on first load via `GET /api/codegraph/architecture` before rendering the graph.

- **Projects import persistence + Codegraph first-load feedback** — GitHub-imported projects now persist the actual cloned workspace path in `cortex-project.json` instead of the metadata directory path, so later Codegraph loads index the real repository. The Codegraph page now shows that first load may take longer while indexing, and surfaces backend error messages instead of a generic empty failure state.

- **API: MCP & Chrome Bridge routes added** — added route handlers for the MCP page and Chrome Bridge settings page:
  - `GET /api/mcp/connections` — list configured MCP connections with status
  - `GET /api/mcp/connections/:name/tools` — browse tools for a connection
  - `POST /api/mcp/connections` — add and connect a new MCP server
  - `POST /api/mcp/connections/:name/connect` — reconnect a disconnected server
  - `POST /api/mcp/connections/:name/disconnect` — gracefully disconnect
  - `DELETE /api/mcp/connections/:name` — remove a connection
  - `GET /api/mcp/server` — local MCP server status
  - `GET /api/chrome-bridge/status` — Chrome Bridge connection state, tools, and metrics
  - `POST /api/chrome-bridge/start` — start the chrome-bridge MCP server
  - `POST /api/chrome-bridge/stop` — stop the chrome-bridge MCP server
  - `GET /api/chrome-bridge/tools` — list registered chrome-bridge tools

- **GitHub token detection on Version Control page** — fixed `getGitHubToken()` to read from the actual config locations (`config.update.githubToken` and `config.pluginUpdate.githubToken`) instead of a non-existent top-level `config.githubToken`, so the page correctly reports configured tokens.

## [0.45.1] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **UI: removed Tailwind CDN from production** — replaced `cdn.tailwindcss.com` script tag with inline CSS (`html { height: 100% }`), removed 3 redundant Tailwind utility class usages (`h-full`, `flex`), and updated CSP headers accordingly
- **UI: fixed SyntaxError on Projects page Delete button** — `JSON.stringify(p.name)` in the onclick handler was emitting double quotes that broke the HTML attribute boundary (`onclick="deleteProject("name")"`). Changed to `escAttr(p.name)` wrapped in single-quote JS string delimiters.
- **UI: vault credential form accessibility** — wrapped vault credential modal inputs in a `<form>` element with proper button types, added `autocomplete="current-password"` to the password field

## [0.45.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Sandbox & Environment (#79, #230, #232, #240)** — full sandbox and environment management suite with environment replication, workspace snapshots, dev environment as code, and bug reproduction studio:

    - `POST /api/sandbox/snapshots` — capture environment snapshot (env vars, dependencies, git state, sandbox config) to JSON + DB
    - `GET /api/sandbox/snapshots` — list snapshots with optional session filter and sensitive-key masking
    - `GET /api/sandbox/snapshots/:id` — single snapshot detail with masked env values
    - `POST /api/sandbox/snapshots/:id/replicate` — replicate snapshot to target workspace (writes commented `.cortex-env-replication.sh`)

    - `DELETE /api/sandbox/snapshots/:id` — delete snapshot (file + DB row)
    - Env key validation (`/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/`) and value length limit (1024 chars)
    - Sensitive env value masking for keys matching `API_KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD|AUTH|CREDENTIAL|PRIVATE_KEY|ACCESS_KEY`
    - Shell-injection-safe env var replication (fully escaped `$`, backtick, `!`, `\`)

  - **Workspace Context Snapshot (#240)** — point-in-time workspace state capture:
    - `POST /api/workspace/snapshots` — capture file tree with SHA-256 hashes, git state, memory context, tool state
    - `GET /api/workspace/snapshots` — list snapshots with session filter

    - `DELETE /api/workspace/snapshots/:id` — delete snapshot
    - Files >10 MB skipped with `skipped:too-large:<size>` placeholder hash
    - Excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store` from scans
    - Workspace Snapshot button in Sessions detail view

  - **Dev Environment as Code (#232)** — serialize environment config into versioned manifests:
    - `POST /api/sandbox/dev-env/generate` — auto-detect language, dependencies, setup commands; generate `DevEnvManifest`
    - `GET /api/sandbox/dev-env/manifest?workspacePath=` — load existing `cortex-devenv.json`
    - `PUT /api/sandbox/dev-env/manifest` — save/update manifest with validation
    - `GET /api/sandbox/dev-env/list` — list all stored manifests
    - Auto-detection of JavaScript (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun), Python (pip), Rust (cargo), Go, Ruby (bundler)
    - Unique default names via SHA-256 hash of workspace path to prevent cross-workspace collisions

  - **Bug Reproduction Studio (#230)** — reproduce issues as sandbox test runs:
    - `POST /api/sandbox/bug-repro` — create bug repro run from issue title, description, language, and code
    - `GET /api/sandbox/bug-repro` — list runs with optional status/session filters
    - `GET /api/sandbox/bug-repro/:id` — single run detail with result
    - `POST /api/sandbox/bug-repro/:id/run` — execute repro in sandbox (docker/subprocess)
    - `DELETE /api/sandbox/bug-repro/:id` — delete run
    - Status lifecycle: `queued` → `running` → `passed` | `failed` | `error`
    - Error handling wraps `runInSandbox` with try/catch for runtime failures

  - **Shared utility modules**:
    - `src/sandbox/git-capture.ts` — unified git state capture (branch, HEAD, porcelain status) used by both replication and workspace snapshot modules
    - `src/sandbox/dependency-detect.ts` — unified dependency detection shared between replication and dev-env-code modules
    - `src/sandbox/snapshot-types.ts` — shared TypeScript interfaces for all four subsystems

- **Sandbox page** — new dedicated page with 4 tabs:
  - **Snapshots tab** — list, capture, view detail, replicate, delete environment snapshots
  - **Workspace tab** — list, capture, restore, delete workspace snapshots
  - **Dev Env tab** — list and generate dev environment manifests
  - **Bug Repro tab** — list, create, run, delete bug reproduction runs
  - Nav entry (🖥 icon) in the Code & Development sidebar section
  - Session-level Snapshot button in the Sessions detail view

- **Database migration #034** — four new tables in `cortex.db`:
  - `sandbox_snapshots` (id, name, session_id, agent_id, created_at, runtime, workspace_path, tags)
  - `workspace_snapshots` (id, name, session_id, agent_id, created_at, file_count, git_branch, tags)
  - `dev_env_manifests` (name PK, version, workspace_path, manifest_json, updated_at)
  - `bug_repro_runs` (id, issue_title, issue_description, language, runtime, status, code, test_code, stdout, stderr, exit_code, duration_ms, passed, fixed_code, rounds, created_at, session_id, tags)
  - Indexes on `session_id`, `created_at DESC`, `status` for all query patterns

- **API endpoint** — `GET /api/sandbox/config` — returns available runtime, docker/gVisor availability, timeout/memory limits, and supported languages (was previously referenced by UI but unimplemented)

- **Path validation** — all 6 sandbox endpoints that accept workspace paths now validate against `..` traversal and scope to `PATHS.workspacesDir` / `PATHS.dataDir`

### Security

- Shell-injection hardened: env var keys validated, values fully escaped in generated replication scripts, exports commented-out by default
- Path traversal prevented: user-controlled workspace paths validated and scoped to allowed directories
- Sensitive env var values masked in API responses (key pattern matching)

## [0.44.1] — 2026-06-19

### Added

    - `POST /api/codegraph/pilot` — reads indexed project files, applies AST-aware pruning and chunking, returns optimized code chunks with dependency and symbol metadata
    - New `code_pilot` agent tool wrapping `codebase-pilot.ts` with token budget, pruning, and file-pattern parameters

### Changed

- **Codegraph page** — added 4 new bottom-panel tabs: Ownership, History, Q&A, Pilot (alongside existing Impact, Architecture, Path Tracer)
- **Tool registry** — `code_pilot` registered as the 60th builtin tool (async import alongside other codegraph tools)
- **Nav sidebar** — added Alcove nav item (📚) after Codegraph

### Fixed

- **Settings page** — resolved stuck "Loading…" state caused by `initPageEnhancements()` overriding `loadSettings` without calling the original. Removed duplicate function blocks and ensured wrapped loader delegates to original.
- **Settings navigation** — consolidated dual navigation bars (internal tabs + global sub-nav) into a single global sub-nav with tabs: General, AI & Models, Tools & Integrations, System. Added quick-access cards to Tools, Chrome Bridge, MCP, MCP Gateway, and Vault within the Tools & Integrations tab. Sub-nav syncs active state across all settings-group pages.
- **Codegraph Q&A onkeydown** — fixed JavaScript syntax error (`Unexpected identifier 'Enter'`) caused by single-quote escaping in `showCodegraphQAPanel` inline handler; changed to `&quot;` HTML entities.

  - Agent loop runs adversarial reflection immediately after normal reflection when `enableReflection` is enabled
  - Adversarial results stored in reflection_memory with category `adversarial`

- **Confidence Task Escalator (#53)** — low-confidence assessments auto-escalate to clarification:
  - Confidence threshold (0.35) in `metacog.ts` — if `assessTask()` produces a `direct` decision with sub-threshold confidence, it escalates to `ask_first` with a clarification prompt
  - `MetaAssessment` now carries `escalated: boolean` and `escalationReason` fields
  - Escalation events logged to `lens_events` with type `escalation`, surfaced in Metacognition page history with red ⚡ badge

  - New `src/agent/sub-agent-tracker.ts` with `trackSubAgentStart()`, `trackSubAgentEnd()`, and `getSubAgentTaskBoard()`
  - Tracking integrated into `sub_agent.ts` tool at start and all completion paths (success, error, fallthrough)
  - In-memory tracking of active tasks + rolling recent history (max 100 completed)
  - "Sub-Agents" tab added to Workflows page: pulsing green dots for active tasks, status badges for completed/failed
  - Active tasks auto-refresh every 3 seconds when tab is selected
  - `GET /api/workflows/tasks` endpoint for the task board data

- **Memory Health Monitor (#70)** — health scoring and warnings for memory stores:
  - `getMemoryHealth()` now computes a 0-100 health score and generates `HealthWarning[]` with severity levels
  - Stale ratio, low decay, low access, unconnected entities, and low reflection confidence trigger warnings
  - Memory page shows color-coded health score bar (green ≥80, amber ≥50, red <50) and warning list

- **Entity Resolution Memory (#66)** — duplicate detection and merging:
  - New `findDuplicateEntities()` in `graph.ts` finds fuzzy-matched entity duplicates across the graph

## [0.43.1] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Fixed non-functional Delete/Trigger/Cancel/Logs buttons in the Jobs tab of the Automation page. The `renderJobCard()` function used `JSON.stringify(job.id)` to embed job IDs in onclick handlers, which wrapped IDs in double quotes that conflicted with the HTML attribute quoting, producing broken HTML. Changed to `esc(job.id)` with properly escaped template-literal single quotes.

## [0.43.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **A2A Protocol Bridge** (`src/a2a/`) — implements Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) v1.0 protocol for cross-framework agent interoperability. Cortex agents can now discover, delegate to, and collaborate with external agents built on LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or any A2A-compliant framework:
  - **A2A data model** (`src/a2a/types.ts`) — full v1.0 type system: `AgentCard`, `Task`, `Message`, `Part`, `Artifact`, `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`, `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`, `SendMessageRequest`, `StreamResponse`, `PushNotificationConfig`, and all security scheme types (API key, OAuth2, OIDC, mTLS).
  - **A2A JSON-RPC server** (`src/a2a/server.ts`) — exposes Cortex agents as A2A endpoints handling `SendMessage`, `SendStreamingMessage` (SSE), `GetTask`, `ListTasks`, `CancelTask`, `GetAgentCard`, `GetExtendedAgentCard`. Multi-turn context tracking with TTL-based eviction (1hr expiry, max 1000 tasks, max 500 contexts). JSON-RPC 2.0 request validation with proper error codes.
  - **A2A client** (`src/a2a/client.ts`) — delegates tasks to remote A2A agents with `fetchAgentCard`, `sendMessage`, `sendStreamingMessage` (SSE streaming parser), `getTask`, `listTasks`, `cancelTask`. AbortController-based timeouts on all outbound calls.
  - **A2A tool wrapper** (`src/a2a/tool-wrapper.ts`) — wraps remote A2A agents as CortexPrism `Tool` objects following the `mcp-adapter.ts` pattern. Agent card caching with automatic retry on failure.
  - **Agent card generator** (`src/a2a/agent-card.ts`) — generates A2A agent cards from Cortex tool definitions, converting tool schemas to `AgentSkill[]` entries with tags, examples, and default interface declarations.
  - **A2A REST endpoints** (`src/server/router.ts`) — `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` (public, pre-auth), `GET /api/a2a/agent-card.json`, `POST /a2a` (JSON-RPC 2.0 gateway).

- **MCP Gateway & Registry** (`src/mcp-gateway/`) — enterprise MCP server management with security and governance:
  - **Gateway** (`src/mcp-gateway/gateway.ts`) — token-bucket rate limiter with configurable requests/min, burst size, and automatic refill. HTTP health checking with tool-count comparison (healthy/degraded/unhealthy). Audit logging with 10K-entry ring buffer. Risk assessment for tool calls (critical: DROP DATABASE, rm -rf /; high: DROP TABLE, DELETE FROM, shutdown; medium: writes, deletes, shells).
  - **Server registry** (`src/mcp-gateway/registry.ts`) — CRUD operations for managed MCP servers with tag-based search, health status filtering, transport-type filtering, and status lifecycle tracking.

- **Memori: Persistent Agent Checkpointing** (`src/memori/`) — full agent state serialization for survival across restarts, crashes, and context window resets:
  - **Checkpoint data model** (`src/memori/types.ts`) — `AgentCheckpoint` with six sub-structures: `CheckpointConversation` (messages, prompt, context window), `CheckpointMemory` (episodic, semantic, graph entities, active skills), `CheckpointTools` (available tools, call history, pending approvals), `CheckpointReasoning` (current goal, sub-goals, completed goals, confidence, reflection notes), `CheckpointWorkspace` (working dir, open files, recent changes, git state), `CheckpointMetadata` (version, provider, model, tokens, cost).
  - **Checkpoint storage** (`src/memori/store.ts`) — SQLite persistence via the libSQL `Db` wrapper with `saveCheckpoint`, `loadCheckpoint`, `loadLatestCheckpoint`, `listCheckpoints` (with session/agent/timerange/tag filters), `deleteCheckpoint`, `deleteSessionCheckpoints`, `pruneOldCheckpoints` (keep last N). Proper use of `db.exec()`/`db.run()`/`db.get<T>()`/`db.all<T>()` API.
  - **Checkpoint capture** (`src/memori/checkpoint.ts`) — `captureCheckpoint()` serializes full agent state from a `CaptureContext` into an `AgentCheckpoint`. Dynamic version import from `src/config/version.ts`. Available tools populated from the tool registry, not call history. Message and tool result truncation at 50K/10K character bounds.
  - **Checkpoint restore** (`src/memori/restore.ts`) — `restoreCheckpoint()` rehydrates agent state including messages, goals, open files, active skills, tool call history, and workspace info. `buildResumePrompt()` generates a structured resume context with goal, completed tasks, remaining sub-goals, reflection notes, recent conversation, working directory, and git state.
  - **Database migration** (`src/db/migrations/032_memori_checkpoints.sql`, `src/db/migrate.ts`) — `memori_checkpoints` table with indexed `(session_id, turn_number DESC)` and `(agent_id, timestamp DESC)`.

- **Dynamic Tool Permission Grant** (`src/security/dynamic-grant.ts`, #62) — per-task tool permission evaluation replacing static allow/deny. `evaluateToolPermission()` returns one of four decisions: `granted`, `granted_with_guardrails`, `denied`, `requires_approval`. Risk profiles for 13 tool categories with default guardrails (readOnly, restrictedPaths, allowedDomains, maxDurationMs, requireConfirmation). Integrates with existing policy engine via `checkPolicy()` and temporary grants via `hasTemporaryGrant()`. Lens audit logging for every grant decision.

- **Tool Approval Workflow Engine** (`src/security/approval-workflow.ts`, #254) — structured approval pipeline for high-risk tool executions. `submitForApproval()` returns a Promise that resolves when a human reviewer approves or denies, or when the 5-minute timeout expires. Auto-approval for low-risk operations (configurable threshold). Webhook-based channel notifications with approve/deny URLs. `approveRequest()` / `denyRequest()` for programmatic resolution. Cleanup timer auto-expires stale requests every 30 seconds. Unified with #62 +#135 into the "Agentic Tool Governance" stack.

- **Data Loss Prevention Guard** (`src/security/dlp.ts`, #137) — comprehensive sensitive data scanning with 22 built-in scanners covering: AWS access/secret keys, GitHub tokens/PATs, OpenAI/Anthropic/Google API keys, JWTs, private keys (RSA/EC/DSA), PEM certificates, database connection strings, Slack/Discord tokens, credit cards, SSNs, emails, IPs, password fields, API key headers, bearer tokens, and basic auth. Three action levels: `monitor`, `redact`, `block`. Non-overlapping match deduplication. `dlpMiddleware()` convenience function with fire-and-forget lens audit logging for blocked/redacted events.

- **AI Guardrails & Content Safety** (`src/security/guardrails.ts`, #179) — pluggable content safety middleware with 5 built-in classifiers: `prompt_injection` (10 detection patterns for ignore-previous-instructions, jailbreak DAN/STAN, system override), `pii_leakage`, `harmful_code` (rm -rf /, DROP DATABASE, eval, os.system), `excessive_length` (>100K chars), `shell_injection` (curl|bash, eval, backtick command substitution). `registerClassifier()` / `unregisterClassifier()` API for custom classifiers. Operates on input and/or output stages. Returns `GuardrailResult` with pass/block/warn per check. Factory functions (`createPreMiddleware`, `createPostMiddleware`) for pipeline hook integration.

- **Session Isolation Boundary** (`src/security/isolation.ts`, #139) — multi-tenant data isolation between Cortex sessions. Three isolation modes: `strict` (no cross-project access), `permissive` (path-only isolation), `shared` (no restrictions). Path-based isolation with workspace root enforcement and allowlist overrides. Environment variable filtering with safe-var allowlist (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, etc.). Cross-session memory access control with shared-session whitelist. Network access gating per mode. Violation recording with lens audit trail (1K ring buffer).

- **Supply Chain Integrity Verifier** (`src/plugins/supply-chain.ts`, #138) — full verification pipeline extending `integrity.ts`: SHA-256 hash check against known-good hashes per package@version, blocked hash list, digital signature verification, author reputation scoring (0–100), blocked/allowed author lists, malware pattern scanning (6 default patterns: eval, child_process, rm -rf /, curl|sh, wget|sh). Configurable `SupplyChainPolicy` with `blockSuspicious` mode. `verifyPluginIntegrity()` returns structured `IntegrityReport` with per-check pass/fail/severity. Lens audit logging for every verification.

- **Dependency Supply Chain Guardian** (`src/plugins/dependency-guardian.ts`, #272) — continuous dependency monitoring across 6 ecosystems (npm, PyPI, Maven, Go, Cargo, NuGet). CVE database with severity-scored vulnerability records. Version range matching for affected-versions parsing (`<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`, exact, wildcard). Risk score calculation (critical=40, high=25, medium=10, low=3 + outdated=10 + blocked-license=15). Blocked license enforcement (GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, BUSL-1.1, SSPL-1.0 by default). `generateGuardianReport()` for per-project vulnerability summaries. Auto-generated remediation suggestions with safe version bump recommendations. `checkAllProjects()` for bulk monitoring. Lens audit logging for every report generation.

- **Skill Bus Orchestrator** (`src/agent/skill-bus.ts`, #54) — pub/sub event bus connecting plugins as composable skills. `createSkillBinding()` wires skills to event types with conditional matching (regex/value, cooldown periods, prerequisite checks). Five action types: `invoke_skill`, `inject_context`, `emit_event`, `call_tool`, `notify`. Listens on `tool:post-execute`, `agent:turn-end`, `session:end`, `config:change` events. Async handler execution with per-binding timeout and cooldown tracking.

- **Context Window Compressor** (`src/agent/context-compressor.ts`, #55) — sliding-window conversation compression with importance-weighted retention. `compressConversation()` scores messages by recency, importance, decision/error/todo content, then retains high-scoring messages up to the target token budget. `analyzeMessage()` auto-detects decisions, errors, and todos from content patterns. `buildCompressedContext()` generates a structured digest with original vs. compressed token counts and percentage savings.

- **Codebase Pilot: Token-Optimized Context** (`src/codegraph/codebase-pilot.ts`, #295) — AST-aware codebase optimization for LLM consumption. `chunkCode()` splits files into signatures, imports, and body chunks with token estimation. `optimizeCodebase()` ranks files by importance (src/ > root, main/index/config/types > tests), prunes private members, strips comments, and enforces token budgets. `buildCodePilotPrompt()` assembles the final context with per-file symbol lists and dependency graphs. Supports 20+ language extensions for detection. Configurable file allowlist/blocklist with exclude patterns for node_modules, .git, dist, build.

- **Cross-Session Context Bridge** (`src/memory/context-bridge.ts`, #64) — retrieves relevant past-session context when starting new sessions. `bridgeSessionContext()` finds sessions matching the current project root and task description, scores by recency and keyword overlap, and aggregates common errors, key decisions, and active code areas. `buildPreloadPrompt()` generates a preload context for the system prompt with suggested focus areas and previously encountered issues. Configurable max sessions and max age (default 5 sessions, 30 days).

- **User Preference Learner** (`src/memory/preference-learner.ts`, #68) — implicit preference model built from user corrections and overrides. `observePreference()` tracks 10 preference categories (coding_style, library_choice, naming_convention, risk_tolerance, communication_style, tool_preference, language_choice, testing_style, documentation_style, architecture_pattern). Confidence scoring with evidence-based reinforcement (match=+0.15, mismatch=×0.7). `learnFromCorrection()` auto-extracts preference signals from natural language corrections. `buildPreferenceContext()` generates system prompt injection with high-confidence (≥60%) preferences organized by category.

- **AgentLint** (`src/agent/agentlint.ts`, #312) — automated auditing of agent configurations, plugin manifests, tool definitions, and system prompts with 33+ checks across 4 categories. Agent config checks: name length, description presence, system prompt validation, tool count, maxTurns range, provider validity, dangerous tool audit. Tool definition checks: name length, description quality (action verbs, ambiguous phrasing), parameter count and descriptions, capability declarations. Plugin manifest checks: version presence, capability scoping, WASM runtime warnings. System prompt checks: instruction clarity, conflicting directives, token efficiency.

- **Responsible AI Auditor** (`src/agent/responsible-ai.ts`, #188) — bias, fairness, and safety auditing for agent outputs with 10 audit categories: demographic bias, gender bias, cultural bias, stereotypes, content safety, code safety, fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. `auditAgentOutput()` produces a `ResponsibleAIReport` with per-category severity scoring (pass/concern/violation), overall score (0-1), and actionable recommendations. `auditBatch()` for bulk output analysis. Lens audit logging for any concern or violation findings. Configurable stereotype, safety, and fairness pattern sets.

- **A2A Bridge UI** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — new sidebar navigation page with agent card display (name, version, streaming capability, skill count), interface endpoint list, and 3-column skills grid. `GET /api/a2a/agent-card.json` endpoint.

- **MCP Gateway UI** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — new Settings sub-tab for enterprise MCP server management. Health dashboard with server count, healthy/degraded breakdown, per-server status badges with tool counts. `GET /api/mcp-gateway/servers` endpoint with aggregated health stats.

- **Memori Checkpointing UI** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — new sidebar navigation page for persistent agent checkpoint viewing. Session ID filter, per-session turn listing with timestamp, token count badges, and goal snapshots. `GET /api/memori/checkpoints` endpoint with sessionId and limit query params.

- **AgentLint UI** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — new standalone audit page with Run Checks button. Summary cards (total checks, passed, warnings, errors), color-coded issue cards with severity badges and actionable suggestions. `GET|POST /api/agentlint/check` endpoints.

- **New lens event types** (`src/db/lens.ts`) — added 9 event types: `dynamic_grant`, `approval_requested`, `approval_decision`, `dlp_blocked`, `dlp_redacted`, `guardrail_blocked`, `isolation_violation`, `supply_chain_verification`, `guardian_report` to the `EventType` union for Tier 2 security feature audit logging.

- **CLI commands for new features** (`src/cli/a2a-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/memori-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/agentlint-cmd.ts`, `src/cli/mcp-gateway-cmd.ts`, `src/main.ts`) — `cortex a2a` (card, skills), `cortex memori` (list, prune), `cortex agentlint` (check, config), `cortex mcp-gateway` (status, health). All registered in main.ts command tree.

- **Pipeline hook integration** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`) — DLP Guard registered as `@cortex/dlp-guard` hook at `pre-output`/`post-tool` stages. Responsible AI Auditor registered as `@cortex/responsible-ai` hook at `post-output` stage. Both use fire-and-forget patterns and never block the pipeline.

- **Startup integration** (`src/server/server.ts`) — Skill Bus initialized at server start after plugin loading. Dependency Guardian scheduled for periodic checks every 6 hours.

- **Supply chain verification on install** (`src/plugins/manager.ts`) — `verifyPluginIntegrity()` called before every plugin install. Plugins with status `blocked` are rejected. Plugins with `suspicious` status log warnings but proceed.

- **A2A auth fix** (`src/server/router.ts`) — `POST /a2a` JSON-RPC endpoint moved to public section (before auth middleware) for agent-to-agent interop without session cookies.

- **Barrel import fixes** (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/security/dynamic-grant.ts`) — all internal module imports now route through `mod.ts` barrels. Removed 3 unused imports from `context-bridge.ts`.

- **Multi-system import system** (`src/cli/import/`) — new shared import module supporting three external agent systems:
  - **Hermes import** (`cortex import hermes`) — parses Hermes JSONL exports with session/message records and ShareGPT `conversations[]` format. Groups records by `session_id`, writes messages into per-session databases, imports system prompts and model info as episodic memory. Auto-detects `~/.hermes/`.
  - **ZeroClaw import** (`cortex import zeroclaw`) — handles JSONL event-sourced transcripts and `MEMORY_SNAPSHOT.md`/`MEMORY.md` memory snapshot files. Transcript events are written as session messages; `branch_summary`/`compaction` events become episodic memory; memory snapshots become semantic memory. Auto-detects `~/.zeroclaw/`.
  - **JSONL transcript import** (`cortex import transcripts`) — shared parser for OpenClaw/ZeroClaw lineage JSONL format with tree-structured events.
  - **API import routing** (`POST /api/import`) — the HTTP API now dispatches to the correct import module based on `type` parameter (`hermes`, `zeroclaw`, `transcripts`, `openclaw`, `auto`), returning structured results with session/message/memory/policy/error counts.

## [0.42.0] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **CSP relaxation** (`src/server/security-headers.ts`) — `connect-src` now includes `http:` and `https:` schemes to allow API connections from the browser. `script-src` includes `https://d3js.org` for D3.js charts. `img-src` includes `blob:` for blob URLs.

- **JetBrains Mono font quoting** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — all `font-family:"JetBrains Mono"` and unquoted `font-family:JetBrains Mono` instances changed to single-quoted `font-family:'JetBrains Mono'` for valid CSS. In single-quoted JavaScript strings embedded in template literals, single quotes are now double-escaped (`\\'` → `\'` in output) to prevent premature JS string termination.

- **Missing `hideModal()` function** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — added the `hideModal(id)` function which was referenced in 7 modal Cancel button `onclick` handlers (MCP add, vault credential, vault import, remote deploy, workflow create, workflow run, eval run) but was never defined, causing `ReferenceError` on every Cancel click.

### Added

- **Chrome Bridge — dynamic MCP tool registration** (`src/tools/mcp-adapter.ts`, `src/tools/registry.ts`) — MCP-connected server tools can now be dynamically registered as first-class CortexPrism tools with automatic JSON Schema→`ToolParam` conversion and capability inference. `ToolRegistry` gains `registerMcpConnection()`, `unregisterByPrefix()` methods for lifecycle management.

- **Chrome Bridge — connection manager** (`src/tools/builtin/chrome_bridge_manager.ts`) — manages the chrome-bridge MCP server subprocess lifecycle with auto-start on demand, graceful shutdown, 30-second health checks via `get_status`, and exponential backoff reconnection (100ms–1600ms, max 5 retries). Module-level state tracks running status, retry count, and timer handles.

- **Chrome Bridge — capability mapping** (`src/tools/builtin/chrome_bridge_capabilities.ts`) — curated capability assignments for all 60 chrome-bridge real-browser automation tools, mapping screenshot/interaction/network/Audit tools to CortexPrism's `ToolCapability` system (`computer:screenshot`, `network:fetch`, `computer:keyboard`, etc.).

- **Chrome Bridge — CLI command** (`src/cli/chrome_bridge.ts`, `src/main.ts`) — `cortex chrome-bridge [start|stop|status|tools]` subcommands for managing the chrome-bridge MCP server from the command line, with colored output and config validation.

- **Chrome Bridge — API endpoints** (`src/server/router.ts`) — `GET /api/chrome-bridge/status` (connection state, tool count, server info), `POST /api/chrome-bridge/start`, `POST /api/chrome-bridge/stop`, and `GET /api/chrome-bridge/tools` REST endpoints follow the established MCP API pattern.

- **Chrome Bridge — Web UI** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — dedicated "Chrome Bridge" page added as a Settings sub-tab with status cards (connection state, server info, tools registered, total calls, errors), a registered tools grid, and Quick Setup section. Added to the settings sub-navigation bar alongside Tools, MCP, and Vault. Start/Stop/Restart header buttons toggle visibility based on running state.

- **Chrome Bridge — quick-connect** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — `quickConnectChromeBridge()` pre-fills the MCP Add Connection modal with chrome-bridge settings (name, transport, command, auto-connect) for one-click setup from the Chrome Bridge page.

- **Chrome Bridge — config schema** (`src/config/config.ts`) — `ChromeBridgeConfig` interface with fields for `enabled`, `autoStart`, `autoRegisterTools`, `toolPrefix`, `serverPath`, `nodePath`, `port`, `token`, and `env`. Added as optional `chromeBridge?` field on `CortexConfig` for backward compatibility.

### Security

- **Chrome Bridge — `execute_js` policy gate** (`src/security/validator.ts`) — `chrome_execute_js` calls require explicit `checkPolicy('tool', 'chrome_execute_js')` allow before executing arbitrary JavaScript in the real browser, with denial logged to the lens events table.

- **Chrome Bridge — upload file path validation** (`src/security/validator.ts`) — `chrome_upload_file` paths are checked for `../` traversal and validated against path policy rules before being passed to the browser's file upload dialog.

- **Chrome Bridge — save/download path validation** (`src/security/validator.ts`) — `chrome_save_page` and `chrome_manage_downloads` paths are stripped of `../` sequences and validated against path policy rules.

- **Chrome Bridge — network rules modification gate** (`src/security/validator.ts`) — `chrome_network_rules` actions other than `list`/`clear` require `checkPolicy('capability', 'network_rules_modify')` approval.

- **Chrome Bridge — log event offloading** (`src/security/validator.ts`) — `chrome_execute_js` success-path event logging is fire-and-forget (`.catch(() => {})`) to avoid adding DB write latency to the critical tool execution path.

- **Chrome Bridge — non-blocking server startup** (`src/server/server.ts`) — auto-start wrapped in `(async () => {...})().catch(() => {})` so chrome-bridge initialization failures never block the HTTP server from accepting connections.

## [0.41.4] — 2026-06-18

### Security

- **Path traversal hardening — tar slip prevention** (`src/plugins/install.ts`) — extracted file paths from tar archives are now validated via `normalize()` to stay within the destination directory, blocking malicious archives with `../` traversal entries (Zip Slip mitigation).

- **Path traversal hardening — plugin name validation** (`src/plugins/install.ts`, `src/plugins/update.ts`) — `pluginDir` construction from remote marketplace or URL manifest names now validates the resolved path stays within the base plugins directory, preventing directory traversal via crafted plugin names.

- **Path traversal hardening — upload and undo/redo** (`src/server/router.ts`) — file upload endpoint now validates the resolved upload path against the upload directory. Undo/redo operations normalize DB-sourced file paths before writing.

- **DoS prevention — unbounded string hashing** (`src/security/supervisor.ts`) — `hashString()` now caps input to 10,000 characters to prevent exponential CPU exhaustion from attacker-controlled query strings.

- **postMessage origin validation** (`src/plugins/extensions/ui.ts`) — both the TypeScript `onEvent` handler and the generated panel JavaScript now validate `MessageEvent.origin` against the window's origin, blocking cross-origin messages from untrusted sites.

- **Dependency upgrade — AWS Bedrock SDK** (`deno.json`) — `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` upgraded from 3.750.0 to 3.1072.0, resolving 6 known vulnerabilities (4 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM) in transitive dependency `fast-xml-parser` and `uuid`.

- **Vault salt hardening** (`src/security/vault.ts`, `src/config/paths.ts`) — replaced static PBKDF2 salt with a per-installation random salt persisted to `vault_salt`, with legacy v1-to-v2 auto-migration on first decrypt. PBKDF2 iterations increased from 100,000 to 200,000.

- **Config encryption** (`src/config/config.ts`) — provider API keys, GitHub tokens, Grafana auth tokens, and Langfuse secret keys are now encrypted with AES-256-GCM before writing to `cortex.json`, preventing plaintext credential exposure on disk.

- **CORS hardening** (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`) — replaced `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` wildcard with configurable origin (defaults to `same-origin`). Added `Vary: Origin` and `Access-Control-Max-Age` headers.

- **Security headers** (`src/server/security-headers.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — added `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers to all HTTP responses.

- **Rate limiting for auth endpoints** (`src/server/router.ts`) — login and password-setup endpoints now enforce per-IP rate limiting (10 requests per 60s window), returning 429 on excess.

- **Request body size limit** (`src/server/server.ts`) — configurable `maxBodyBytes` (default 10 MB) enforced via `Content-Length` header check, returning 413 on oversized requests.

- **HTTPS/TLS support** (`src/server/server.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`) — server now accepts optional `certFile`/`keyFile` in `server.https` config section to serve over TLS.

- **Session cookie `Secure` flag** (`src/server/auth.ts`) — session cookies now include the `Secure` attribute to prevent transmission over cleartext HTTP.

- **XSS sanitizer rewrite** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — `sanitizeHtml()` regex patterns fixed (were double-escaped and non-functional) and extended to strip `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<style>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<svg>`, `<form>`, `javascript:` URIs, and `expression()` calls in custom dashboard widgets.

- **Vault key isolation** (`src/tools/builtin/env_manager.ts`) — `CORTEX_VAULT_KEY` removed from the env_manager allow-list. The `get` operation now enforces the same allow-list as `set`, preventing agents from reading arbitrary environment variables.

- **SSRF protection** (`src/security/ssrf.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/web_fetch.ts`) — `web_fetch` tool now performs DNS resolution and blocks requests to private/internal IP ranges (127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16, IPv6 link-local/unique-local), as well as known metadata hosts.

- **Subprocess sandbox env filtering** (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`) — subprocess fallback mode no longer passes sensitive environment variables (containing PASSWORD, SECRET, TOKEN, KEY, VAULT) to executed code.

- **Enhanced Docker sandbox** (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`, `src/sandbox/agent-sandbox.ts`) — TypeScript code execution in Docker mode now uses read-only root filesystem, `noexec`/`nosuid` tmpfs, and Deno permissions scoped to workspace (`--allow-read=/workspace`, `--allow-write=/workspace`).

- **Approval gate for git_push** (`src/tools/builtin/github/git_push.ts`) — `git_push` tool now requires user approval before committing and pushing, showing the commit message summary.

- **Sub-agent tool escalation lock** (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`) — the `tools` parameter now intersected against the sub-agent type's built-in allow-list, preventing sub-agents from requesting tools beyond their intended scope.

- **API key query string removal** (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`) — the `/api/providers/:kind/models` endpoint now accepts API keys via POST body instead of URL query parameters, preventing secret leakage through server logs and browser history.

- **postMessage target hardening** (`src/plugins/extensions/ui.ts`) — `emit()` now sends messages to `globalThis.location.origin` instead of `'*'`, preventing cross-origin data leaks from extension panels.

- **WebSocket broadcast scoping** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — `broadcast()` now filters recipients by session ID, preventing cross-session event leakage (file changes, voice state) between unrelated clients.

- **CSP and regex escape fix** (`src/server/security-headers.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`) — relaxed Content-Security-Policy to allow `https://d3js.org` (D3.js), `ws:`/`wss:` (WebSocket), and `blob:` (image data). Fixed regex patterns in `sanitizeHtml()` where backslash escapes were stripped by template literal processing.

## [0.41.3] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Daemon health and restart handling** (`src/server/server.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/services/manager.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`) — server startup now boots auto-start services, daemon health reports real supervisor and service-manager status, and the Daemons page restart dialog uses a restart-specific action label.

- **Pluggable memory vector stores** (`src/config/config.ts`, `src/memory/store.ts`, `src/memory/vector_backends.ts`) — memory writes now mirror embeddings into built-in Qdrant, ChromaDB, and Pinecone adapters when configured, with SQLite remaining the authoritative fallback.

- **Memory hardening pass** (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/services/manager.ts`, `src/memory/privacy.ts`, `src/memory/consolidate.ts`) — daemon restart now requires auth, auto-start reconciles runtime state on boot, vector-store mirroring is non-blocking, and retention/pruning now removes remote vector records too.

- **Heuristics page refresh** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/memory/heuristics.ts`) — the memory heuristics panel now shows real category cards, rule counts, and a one-click heuristic cycle runner instead of a static category list.

- **Vector store settings** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/config/config.ts`) — the memory page now includes a dedicated vector-store tab for Qdrant, ChromaDB, Pinecone, and SQLite fallback configuration.

- **Memory page consolidation** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — combined health, reflections, and persistent notes into a single Overview tab, leaving Search and Graph as the primary exploration views.

- **Session restore hardening** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — stale saved session ids now fail soft instead of spamming `/resume` and `/messages` 404s, and invalid session state is cleared from local storage.

- **Settings subnav cleanup** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — removed the duplicate Policies entry from the shared settings/tools/MCP/vault sub-navigation so Policies now appears only in the main page navigation.

- **Workflow history persistence** (`src/workflow/engine.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — workflow runs are now recorded to a local history log so the Workflows history tab shows actual executions such as health-check runs.

## [0.41.2] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Stubbed workflow completion** (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`,
  `src/hub/ws-node.ts`, `src/memory/store.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/memory_search.ts`) — update
  checks now hit the correct endpoint, computer-use screenshots/actions are backed by persisted
  data, pending remote directives are listed from live state, import history is persisted, and
  memory search now respects session scope and approval flow.

- **Model Quartermaster and supervisor selection** (`src/model-quartermaster/arbiter.ts`,
  `src/model-quartermaster/mod.ts`, `src/security/supervisor.ts`) — budget and health constraints
  now filter candidates, estimated quality is derived from active signals, and the supervisor can
  consult MQM when model selection is enabled.

- **Workspace global path fix** (`src/workspace/paths.ts`) — global workspace paths now resolve to
  the current workspace root so the existing workspace-path contract matches the tests and CLI.

## [0.41.1] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Editor & VCS default directories** (`src/workspace/paths.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`,
  `src/cli/git-cmd.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`) — Editor and version control no longer default to
  the cortex install directory (`Deno.cwd()`). `getGlobalWorkspaceDir()` now returns
  `PATHS.workspacesDir` (`~/.cortex/data/workspaces`). All git API endpoints and the CLI git
  command use `getGlobalWorkspaceDir()` as fallback. Editor defaults to the first available
  agent workspace; VCS agent selector defaults to the first available agent.

## [0.41.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added — Agent Builder Overhaul: Multi-Select Dropdowns, 6 New Sub-Agent Types, Clone, & Enhanced Config

- **6 new built-in sub-agent types** (`src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`) — Security Auditor (vulnerability
  assessment), Debugger (root cause analysis), Architect (system design & trade-offs), DevOps Engineer
  (infrastructure & CI/CD), Data Analyst (queries & insights), UI/UX Designer (accessible interfaces).
  Each with domain-specific system prompts and curated tool sets.

- **Agent builder multi-select dropdowns** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — Replaced comma-separated text inputs
  for tools and tags with interactive multi-select dropdowns:
  - **Tools dropdown** — Checkbox list grouped by prefix (`file_`, `web_`, `code_`, etc.) with
    real-time search/filter, fetched dynamically from the tool registry
  - **Tags dropdown** — Common tag suggestions as checkboxes plus free-form custom tag input with
    Enter-key support; selected tags rendered as removable chips
  - Both dropdowns close on outside click

- **Icon picker** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — 30-emoji grid popup for visually identifying agents at a
  glance; triggers open on click, closes on outside click

- **Agent category & version** (`src/config/config.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`) — New `category` field
  (general/specialist/assistant/creative/analytics/ops/custom with emoji labels in dropdown) and
  `version` string for agent classification. Displayed as badges on agent cards.

- **Agent cloning** (`src/agent/manager.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/cli/agent-cmd.ts`,
  `src/server/ui.ts`) — `cloneAgent()` deep-copies an existing agent with a new ID. Exposed as:
  - `POST /api/agents/:id/clone` REST endpoint
  - `cortex agent clone <source-id> <new-name>` CLI command
  - Clone button on each agent card in the UI

- **Tool registry API** (`src/server/router.ts`) — New `GET /api/tools/list` endpoint returns all
  registered tool names from the global registry, powering the tools multi-select dropdown.

- **Enhanced CLI options** (`src/cli/agent-cmd.ts`) — `cortex agent create` and `update` now accept
  `--icon`, `--category`, and `--version` flags. `cortex agent show` displays all new fields.

- **Agent icon & category display** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — Agent cards now show the assigned emoji
  icon, version badge, and category badge at a glance.

## [0.40.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added — Sub-Agent Progress Streaming, Improved Metacognition & Bulk Skill Deletion

- **Real-time sub-agent progress in chat UI** — Sub-agent work is now displayed as
  live-streamed, collapsible cards in the main chat. Each sub-agent shows its type,
  task description, spinning progress indicator, streaming output, and completion
  status (DONE/FAILED). (`src/tools/types.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`,
  `src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`)

- **Tool progress streaming API** — New `ToolProgressEvent` discriminated union and
  `onProgress` callback on `ToolContext` enables any tool to stream real-time
  progress events to the client during execution. (`src/tools/types.ts`)

- **Scoring-based metacognition system** — Replaced the linear if-else chain with a
  weighted scoring engine across four decision dimensions (delegate, parallelize,
  plan_with_rollback, direct). Added confidence scores, signal breakdown, expanded
  keyword sets, and more delegation triggers (multi-step code tasks, code+research
  combos, deep investigation). (`src/agent/metacog.ts`)

- **Stronger system prompt guidance** — Meta-cognition prefix now uses directive
  language ("You MUST use the sub_agent tool"), includes available sub-agent type
  descriptions, and frames delegation as the recommended approach for complex tasks.
  (`src/agent/metacog.ts`)

- **Bulk skill deletion** — New `deleteSkills()` function supports mass deletion of
  skills in a single operation. The REST API `DELETE /api/skills` accepts multiple
  `?name=` params or a JSON body `{ names: [...] }`. The UI bulk action bar now
  makes one HTTP call instead of N. The `skill_write` tool exposes a `bulk_delete`
  operation. All paths include proper dependency checking (co-deleted skills are
  excluded), LIKE wildcard escaping, and transaction safety.
  (`src/memory/skills.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`,
  `src/tools/builtin/skill_write.ts`)

## [0.39.0] — 2026-06-18

  instructions, troubleshooting, and performance tips for all platforms

### Changed

- **Discord adapter refactored** — `DiscordAdapter` renamed to `DiscordChannelPlugin`,
  implements full `ChannelPlugin` interface (9/9 methods), legacy adapter preserved as
  `discord_legacy.ts`

### Fixed

- **HttpClient FormData Content-Type bug** — No longer adds `application/json` header
  to FormData requests (which broke file uploads)
- **Telegram polling offset** — Added `offset` parameter to `getUpdates` to prevent
  duplicate message processing
- **Slack WebSocket reconnection** — Disabled built-in WebSocketManager auto-reconnect
  for Slack (URLs expire, must fetch new URL)
- **Bounded queues** — WebSocketManager (1000) and RateLimiter (10000) now enforce
  maximum queue sizes to prevent memory exhaustion
- **API error messages** — Slack, Telegram, Lark, and WhatsApp now include API error
  details in thrown exceptions
- **Message truncation warnings** — Discord (2000), Slack (4000), Telegram (4096),
  WhatsApp (4096) now log warnings when messages are truncated

---

## [0.38.3] — 2026-06-18

### Changed — Phase 5

- **Observability connection tests** — Replaced fake `setTimeout` stubs with real HTTP pings:
  - `POST /api/observability/test-otlp` — pings configured OTLP endpoint and reports status
  - `POST /api/observability/test-langfuse` — authenticates and pings Langfuse API health endpoint
  - UI buttons now show real connection results instead of hardcoded success messages

  - UI displays live PID + command for each running sub-agent

- **CPL YAML import** — Now parses actual YAML from the editor textarea:
  - Extracts `name`, `kind`, `pattern`, `effect` from YAML key-value pairs
  - Posts parsed values to `POST /api/policies` instead of hardcoded placeholder

- **Prometheus metrics parser** — Improved parsing and display:
  - Handles label-bearing metrics (metric_name{labels} value)
  - Separates gauges and counters (detects `_total`, `_count`, `_sum` suffixes)
  - Shows labels inline for better metric identification

---

## [0.38.2] — 2026-06-18

### Changed — Phase 3

- **Stub endpoints wired to real backends** — 20+ previously empty stub endpoints now return real
  data:
  - Router history/decisions: reads from QM `qm_patterns` and `qm_decisions` tables
  - Metacognition history/decisions: queries `lens_events` for metacognition/reflection events
  - Supervisor cache: exposes live `decisionCache` entries via new `getDecisionCacheEntries()`
    export

- **Supervisor cache inspection** — New `getDecisionCacheEntries()` returns live cache state

### Fixed

- Security supervisor GET now reads from actual config instead of hardcoded defaults

---

## [0.38.1] — 2026-06-18

### Added — Phase 2

- Phase 2 scaffolding: 6 new Phase-2 UI pages and 24 REST endpoints for Phase 2 navigation and data
  fetch.
- Phase 2 endpoints scaffolded at /api/phase2/page{n}/{content|config|state|stats} (six pages, 24
  endpoints).
- Global left-nav persistence groundwork: ensure Tools & Policies appear and remain visible across
  page switches.

---

## [0.38.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added — Major

- **Security supervisor system** — Three-layer LLM-based access control for sensitive data:
  - Data classification: automatic sensitivity detection (SECRET/SENSITIVE/NORMAL/PUBLIC)

- **Consolidated tool registration** — Eliminated 125+ lines of duplication across 4 entry points:
  - Centralized `registerAllBuiltins()` in `src/tools/registry.ts`
  - 43 builtin tools grouped by category
  - Applied to ws.ts, cli/chat.ts, service-entry.ts, sub-agent-entry.ts

- **memory_search tool** — Agent memory search with automatic security supervision:
  - Search across episodic, semantic, reflection, and graph memory tiers
  - Hybrid search: keyword matching + vector similarity (embedding-powered)
  - Time-decay scoring (episodic 14-day, semantic 30-day half-lives)
  - Tier filtering and optional session scoping
  - Automatic sensitivity classification on results
  - Security supervisor integration for SENSITIVE/SECRET hits

- **db_query tool** — Read-only database querying with security supervision:

### Web UI Coverage — 58/58 Systems (100%)

Five implementation phases took the SPA from partial to full coverage across all backend systems.
The sidebar was restructured from 8 sections / 37 items down to 5 sections / 25 items.

**New Management Pages (14):**

| Page          | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Metacognition | Task assessment tester, decision distribution, assessment history                   |

**Page Extensions (18 tabs/sections added to existing pages):**

| Page          | Extensions                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Settings      | Providers comparison, Router dashboard, Security Supervisor config, Metrics, Observability |
| Memory        | Privacy (PII redaction, retention), Heuristics (12 auto-categorization rules), Embeddings  |
| Agents        | Sub-Agent Types (5 type cards with tool allow-lists, maxTurns), Process Management         |
| Code Runner   | Sandbox Config (runtime, languages, Docker/gVisor status)                                  |

| Skills        | Export/Merge/Dependencies/Health actions                                                   |
| Editor        | Workspace History tab                                                                      |
| Quartermaster | Config button                                                                              |
| Automation    | Webhook Test-Fire button                                                                   |
| VCS           | Git Diff viewer                                                                            |

**Orphaned Endpoints Connected (10):** Skills export/merge/dependencies/health, workspace history,
QM/MQM config, voice providers, webhook test-fire, git diff

**Sidebar Restructure:** 8 sections → 5 sections, 37 items → 25 items. Merged 8 standalone pages
into 5 tabbed anchor pages with persistent global sub-navigation bar. Anchors: Infrastructure
(Services/Nodes/Daemons), Automation (Triggers/Workflows/Eval/Jobs), Tools & MCP, Security
(Policies/Vault), Remote Access (Remote/Computer).

**+90 REST API endpoints** across codegraph, workflows, eval, MCP, vault, computer, remote, daemons,
import/export, update, reflection, providers, router, tools, memory, metacognition, sub-agents,
voice, sandbox, supervisor, and classification.

**Infrastructure:** D3.js v7 CDN, in-memory storage for eval/workflow engines, `injectSubNav()`
global tab bar system, page extension framework with DOM-safe injection.

### Fixed

- **Route ordering:** Moved `/api/agents/sub-types` before wildcard `/api/agents/:id` regex match to
  prevent 404s (static routes must precede regex wildcards in the if-else chain)
- **Sub-nav persistence:** Replaced page-local sub-nav bars with a single global `#global-subnav`
  bar outside page divs, preventing tabs from disappearing on page switches
- **Memory extension tabs:** `switchMemExtTab` now properly hides all 5 main memory panes when
  showing Privacy/Heuristics/Embeddings content; main memory tabs hide extension content
- **Agents/Code Runner/Policies tabs:** Replaced fragile DOM selectors (`div:last-of-type`,
  `[style*="overflow-y:auto"]`) with stable element IDs and stored references
- **JS escaping:** Fixed 4 instances of literal `\n` in inline strings rendering as actual newlines
  in the output HTML, breaking browser JavaScript parsing
- **Orphan page cleanup:** Removed unreachable `status`, `importexport`, `update`, `reflection`, and
  `voice` page divs and JS code after they were removed from the PAGES array

### Security

- All sensitive data access now requires LLM supervisor review or human approval
- Agents cannot access sensitive memory, audit logs, or databases without justification
- Temporary grants prevent repeated approval prompts for same operation
- Supervisor decisions cached per session (1-hour TTL) to reduce costs

### Documentation

- New `docs/SECURITY_SUPERVISOR.md` — architecture guide with diagrams
- Updated `docs/TOOLS_CONFIGURATION.md` — security model section
- Updated `README.md` with full Web UI table and REST API reference
- 14 comprehensive unit tests for classification and approval systems

## [0.37.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added — Major

- **Code intelligence system** — New `src/codegraph/` module with tree-sitter WASM parser for 14+
  languages. AST extraction, call resolution, complexity estimation, and code graph storage in
  `memory.db`.

- **Code graph schema** — 14 node labels (CodeProject, CodeFile, CodeFunction, CodeClass,
  CodeInterface, etc.), 18 edge types (CALLS, IMPORTS, DEFINES, IMPLEMENTS, INHERITS, HTTP_CALLS,
  ASYNC_CALLS, DECORATES, etc.). Full-text search via FTS5 on code_nodes. Supports all tree-sitter
  languages with lazy-loading from CDN.

- **6 code intelligence tools** — Auto-exposed via MCP server and WebSocket handler:
  - `code_index`: Full repository indexing with incremental sync, file change detection, and chunked
    bulk insert
  - `code_search_symbol`: FTS5-backed symbol search across projects
  - `code_trace_path`: Bidirectional call graph traversal (inbound/outbound) with depth limits and
    hotspot analysis
  - `code_get_architecture`: System architecture diagram extraction (layers, modules, dependencies)
  - `code_analyze_impact`: Blast radius analysis (callers, callees, dead code detection, complexity)
  - `code_list_projects`: Project registry with language stats and node/edge counts

- **Codegraph resolver** — 6-strategy call target resolution: exact symbol match, method on class,
  wildcard import, relative import path, type inference, fallback search. Supports
  JS/TS/Python/Go/Rust/Java/Kotlin import syntax.

- **Batch-aware codegraph sync** — Incremental indexing pipeline with file hashing, bounded
  directory walk (200K file limit, 100 depth), and BFS-batched query execution (2 queries/level
  instead of N+1). WASM integrity validation for tree-sitter.

### Fixed

- **Migration SQL parsing** — Collapsed multi-line SQL statements to single lines to avoid parser
  failures during migration application. Removed FTS5 triggers to simplify initial deployment.

---

## [0.36.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added — Major

- **Embedding-based skill retrieval** — `findMatchingSkills()` now accepts an `EmbeddingProvider`;
  ranks skills via cosine similarity against precomputed embeddings with lexical fallback.
  `buildSkillEmbeddingIndex()` precomputes embeddings from skill name + description + content.
  Embedder is passed through from the agent loop and server startup.

- **Skill deduplication** — `findSimilarSkills()` detects near-duplicate skills via embedding
  similarity. `mergeSkill()` combines steps, descriptions, and content from two skills, archives the
  source, and bumps the target version. `deduplicateExtractedSkill()` auto-runs after each LLM
  extraction session.

- **Skill lifecycle management** — 6-state lifecycle:
  `candidate → verified → released → degraded →
  deprecated → archived`. Built-in skills default to
  `released`, LLM-extracted skills start as `candidate`. `promoteSkill()` transitions up,
  `deprecateSkill()`/`degradeSkill()` transition down. Deprecated/archived skills are excluded from
  agent matching and the available list.

- **Skill health system** — `getSkillHealth()` computes a composite score from utility (usage +
  success), redundancy (duplicate penalty), freshness (time-decay from last use), and failure risk
  (1 − success rate). `runSkillHealthMaintenance()` auto-deprecates stale/low-quality LLM skills.

- **Quality signals** — `utility_score` (Bayesian rolling average with success bonus), `freshness`
  (30-day half-life decay, computed by `computeSkillFreshness()`), `token_cost`. All updated on
  `recordSkillSuccess()`/`recordSkillFailure()`.

- **Security trust tiering** — 4-tier system on `trust_tier` column: 1 (untrusted/LLM-extracted), 2
  (provisional), 3 (trusted/human-authored), 4 (vetted/built-in). `filterReliableSkills()` gates
  agent exposure based on tier + success rate. Trust stars rendered in system prompt and web UI.

- **Skill dependency graph** — `depends_on` and `conflicts_with` columns (JSON arrays of skill
  names). `getSkillDependents()`/`getSkillDependencies()` traverse the graph. `deleteSkill()` blocks
  deletion if other skills depend on the target.

- **Hierarchical skill organization** — `parent_skill_id` column enables skill trees. Built-in
  skills can declare parent relationships via `BuiltinSkill.parentSkillId`.

- **Improved LLM skill extraction** — Prompt upgraded with few-shot examples (good extraction vs.
  non-reusable pattern), validation rules, prerequisite capture, and expected outcomes. Max tokens
  increased from 512 → 1024. Steps now require tool name and params placeholders.

- **Skill evaluation benchmark** — New `tests/skills_eval_test.ts` with 13 tests covering: CRUD,
  lifecycle promotion, lexical search, reliability filtering, merge, dependencies, health scores,
  freshness computation, health maintenance, stats metrics, extraction rejection/validity, and
  lifecycle-filtered listing.

- **Server API endpoints** — `POST /api/skills/merge`, `POST /api/skills/deprecate`,
  `POST
  /api/skills/promote`, `GET /api/skills/dependencies?name=`,
  `GET /api/skills/health?name=`. Existing `GET /api/skills` now supports `?lifecycle=` filter.

- **Skill management UI** — Lifecycle badges (color-coded by state), trust tier stars (★☆☆☆ to
  ★★★★), utility/freshness scores in stats bar. Health check button runs maintenance.
  Promote/deprecate buttons per skill. Lifecycle filter tabs (Released, Deprecated). All rendered in
  both card and list views.

### Changed

- **`skill_write` tool** — Expanded from 3 operations to 8: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `merge`,
  `promote`, `deprecate`, `dependents`, `dependencies`. New params: `lifecycle`, `trust_tier`,
  `depends_on`, `conflicts_with`, `parent_skill_id`, `reason`, `source_name`.

- **`skill_read` tool** — Added `lifecycle` filter parameter; listings now show trust stars and
  lifecycle badges.

- **`load_skill` tool** — Output now includes lifecycle, trust tier, utility score, and freshness.
  Auto-records `last_used_at` on load.

- **Agent loop** — Skill matching delegates to embedding-based retrieval when embedder is available.
  Uses `filterReliableSkills()` instead of inline filtering. Auto-deduplicates after LLM extraction.

- **Startup** — `registerBuiltinSkills()` accepts optional `EmbeddingProvider`; builds embedding
  index as fire-and-forget after registration. Server startup passes config-built embedder.

- **`BuiltinSkill` interface** — Added `parentSkillId`, `dependsOn`, `conflictsWith` optional
  fields.

- **DB migration 023** — Adds 14 columns + 5 indexes to `procedural_memory`.

## [0.35.3] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Extensions page** — Redesigned Installed and Discover tabs from list layout to responsive card
  grid with colored icon headers, expandable readme support, and richer metadata display.

## [0.35.2] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed — High

- **Persistent memory file formatting** — Fixed `appendToMemoryFile()` insertion point calculation;
  `sectionBody.slice(lastBullet).indexOf('\\n')` always returned 0, causing new entries to be
  inserted before the last bullet instead of after it.
- **Chat auto-scroll** — `appendBubble()` and chunk handler now use `requestAnimationFrame` for
  scroll-to-bottom to ensure DOM layout is complete before scrolling. `restoreSession()` adds a
  delayed secondary scroll for mid-conversation resume.

### Added — High

- **Session titles** — Sessions now auto-generate a title from the first 60 characters of the first
  user message. Added `updateSessionName()` in sessions DB layer, `PATCH
  /api/sessions/:id` API
  endpoint, and title display in chat header, sidebar, and sessions list.
- **Session archiving** — Added archive and restore buttons to the sessions list. Archived sessions
  are shown with reduced opacity. Archive API already existed (`POST
  /api/sessions/:id/archive`);
  UI now exposes it.

### Fixed — Medium

- **Services/agents page loading** — Added `agents: loadAgents` and `services: loadServices` to
  `showPage()` loaders so pages render on initial navigation instead of requiring a manual refresh
  click.
- **Skills tag filtering** — Replaced flat button pills with a `<select>` dropdown filter for skill
  tags to declutter the toolbar when many tags are present.
- **Policy management** — Added `enabled` column to `policy_rules` (migration 022), enable/disable
  toggle checkboxes, inline editing of pattern and reason, and an add-policy form in the Policies
  page. New API endpoints: `PATCH/DELETE /api/policies/:id`, `PUT
  /api/policies/:id/toggle`,
  `POST /api/policies`.
- **Discover tab filtering** — Marketplace Discover tab now hides plugins and agents that are
  already installed, keeping the page clean and focused on new content.

## [0.35.1] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed — Critical

- **Voice CLI subcommands** — Rewrote `voice` command to use correct Cliffy subcommand API pattern.
  `voice enable`, `voice disable`, `voice status`, `voice set-voice`, and `voice set-speed` all now
  execute correctly instead of showing help text.
- **OpenAI streaming parameters** — Streaming calls now correctly pass `max_tokens`, `temperature`,
  and `top_p`; previously they were dropped causing unconstrained token generation.
- **o-series model support** — Added o1/o3 detection in both `openai.ts` and `openai-compatible.ts`;
  reasoning models now use `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` and omit unsupported
  `temperature`/`top_p` parameters.
- **Google Gemini generation config** — `temperature`, `topP`, and `maxOutputTokens` are now
  properly passed to `generateContent()` and `generateContentStream()`, fixing silent parameter
  drops.
- **Tool registration** — `file_copy` and `file_move` tools are now registered in all three tool
  maps (chat CLI, WebSocket server, sub-agent entry), making them callable.
- **File undo/redo** — Undo now uses `resolveWorkspacePath()` for path validation, supports restore
  of rename and delete operations, and correctly parses `file_rename.ts` log format. Redo now
  correctly restores the original edit content rather than re-applying the undo.

### Fixed — High

- **Enhanced tools registered** — `file_read_enhanced`, `web_search_enhanced`, and
  `web_fetch_enhanced` are now registered in the chat CLI and WebSocket server tool maps.
- **Web domain policy validation** — Extended domain policy checks to cover `web_fetch`,
  `firecrawl`, `brave_search`, `tavily_search`, `serpapi_search`, and all enhanced web tools. Node
  directive validation also now includes web domain policy checks.
- **FILE_TOOLS set** — Added `file_copy`, `file_move`, `file_undo`, `file_redo`, and `file_glob` to
  the path-validation set in both `validateToolCall` and `validateNodeDirective`.
- **WASM plugin loading** — WASM plugins are no longer skipped in `loadAllPlugins`. The loader now
  correctly dispatches to `loadWasmPlugin()` for `type: 'wasm'` plugins.

### Fixed — Medium

- **AbortSignal propagation** — Added `AbortSignal` support to `openai`, `anthropic`, `cohere`, and
  `ollama` providers for request cancellation and timeout enforcement.
- **Vault enforcement** — `usage_limit`, `expires_at`, and `allowed_agents` are now checked before
  credential decryption. Access logging is now fire-and-forget to prevent logging failures from
  breaking credential retrieval.
- **Cohere provider** — Added `top_p` parameter support with `!= null` guard, wrapped `temperature`
  in null guard for both complete and stream, added content block coercion for multimodal inputs,
  and wrapped stream JSON parsing in try/catch for malformed NDJSON lines.
- **Ollama provider** — Added `top_p` parameter support, fixed inconsistent default values between
  `complete()` and `stream()` (both now use `temperature: 0.7`, `num_predict: 4096`), removed
  duplicate `OllamaResponse` interface, and wrapped stream JSON parsing in try/catch.
- **Bedrock provider** — Added `topP` to `inferenceConfig` and null guards on `maxTokens` and
  `temperature` parameters.
- **Hardcoded versions** — Replaced hardcoded `'0.20.0'` version strings in MCP server and remote
  agent with `getVersion()` from `src/config/version.ts` (reads VERSION file).
- **Service log capture** — `getServiceLogs()` now reads last 200 lines from `stderr.log` instead of
  returning an empty string.
- **Lens metrics** — Added `writeMetric()`, `getMetrics()`, and `getSessionCostTotal()` store
  functions for the `lens_metrics` table.
- **Router error logging** — Empty catch blocks in `buildCascadeRouter` and `buildThresholdRouter`
  now log warnings with the error message.
- **WASM host functions** — Implemented `http_request` (fetch with timeout), `get_config` (env
  vars), and `set_state`/`get_state` (in-memory Map). WASM tool execution now correctly encodes and
  passes the tool name to `plugin_execute_tool`.
- **OpenClaw migration** — `openclaw-migrate.ts` is now wired into the `import` command as a `files`
  subcommand instead of being dead code.

### Fixed — Low

- **FTS query sanitization** — Added `sanitizeFtsQuery()` helper to strip FTS5 special characters
  from search queries in both episodic and semantic memory search.
- **Memory retention** — Retention enforcement now covers `semantic_memory` and `reflection_memory`
  in addition to `episodic_memory`.
- **Eval runner** — `toolCallsMade` is now tracked via `AgentTurnResult` instead of being hardcoded
  to 0.
- **Tool result formatting** — `formatToolResults` now emits `truncated` and `outputLength`
  attributes in `<tool_result>` XML tags.
- **File patch cleanup** — Temp `.patch` files are now cleaned up in a try/finally block to prevent
  leaks on process crash.
- **Skill write** — Step `description` now correctly reads from `step.description` with fallback to
  `step.action`.
- **Speak/Listen tools** — Added `['network:fetch']` capabilities to both tools.
- **Miscellaneous** — Removed duplicate `web_fetch` tool entry in WebSocket server tool map; fixed
  inconsistent `OllamaResponse` interface duplication; added null guards on Bedrock inference config
  parameters; placed `afterText` variable outside try block in `file_patch` to fix scoping.

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md** — Updated LLM provider count from 12 to 24.

---

## [0.35.0] — 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Consolidated settings navigation** — reduced 11 settings tabs to 4 grouped tabs:
  - **General** — Agent behavior, user profile, UI & appearance, web authentication
  - **AI & Models** — LLM providers, model routing (RouteLLM)
  - **Tools & Extensions** — Voice & TTS, tool API keys, computer use (GUI automation)
  - **System** — Automatic updates, plugin updates, logging, OTLP, Grafana, Langfuse

- **Consolidated sidebar navigation** — reduced 7 nav sections to 5 with smarter categorization:
  - **Core** — Dashboard, Chat, Sessions (moved from Management)
  - **Intelligence** — Memory, Skills, Soul (moved from Configuration), Activity
  - **Development** — Editor, Code Runner, Version Control (merged Git+GitHub), Projects (moved from
    Management)
  - **Infrastructure** — Agents, Services, Nodes, Jobs, Automation (merged Hooks+Triggers), Channels
  - **System** — Settings, Policies, Extensions (merged Plugins+Marketplace), Analytics,
    Quartermaster

- **Merged related pages with internal tab navigation**:
  - Git + GitHub → **Version Control** (Local / Remote tabs)
  - Hooks + Triggers → **Automation** (Hooks / Triggers tabs)
  - Plugins + Marketplace → **Extensions** (Installed / Discover tabs)

- **Fixed duplicate Plugin Panels section** in sidebar navigation

---

- Sensitive data detection prevents typing passwords/API keys
- All operations logged in Cortex Lens audit system
- Runs in isolated virtual display (not host display)
- No direct filesystem access (use separate file tools)

#### Tool Configuration UI

- **Tools & APIs Settings Tab** — new settings tab in web UI for managing tool API keys and
  configurations without editing config files or using CLI
- **Tool Configuration API** — REST endpoints (`GET/PUT/DELETE /api/tools/config`) for managing tool
  settings programmatically
- **Vault Integration** — tool API keys stored securely in encrypted vault (AES-256-GCM) with
  automatic fallback to environment variables
- **Visual Tool Management** — see configured vs. available tools, add/edit/remove API keys through
  intuitive UI
- **Supported Tools** — Brave Search, Tavily Search, Firecrawl (API key + self-hosted URL), SerpAPI
  configuration
- **Masked Key Display** — configured keys shown with first 6 and last 4 characters visible (e.g.,
  `sk-abc...xyz`)

#### Enhanced Web Tools

- **Web Search Cache System** (`src/tools/builtin/web/cache.ts`) — persistent caching for web search
  results with TTL (1 hour default), automatic cleanup, and cache size management (max 1000 entries)
- **Enhanced Web Search** (`web_search_enhanced`) — multi-provider search with intelligent fallback
  (Brave → Tavily → DuckDuckGo), automatic retry on failure (up to 2 attempts), result caching, and
  provider preference support
- **Enhanced Web Fetch** (`web_fetch_enhanced`) — improved content extraction with HTML-to-Markdown
  conversion, better entity decoding, automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts),
  improved error messages with actionable suggestions, and more realistic User-Agent headers

#### New File Management Tools

- **File Copy Tool** (`file_copy`) — copy files or directories to new locations with overwrite
  protection, git integration, automatic parent directory creation, and edit logging
- **File Move Tool** (`file_move`) — move or rename files/directories efficiently with atomic
  operations, overwrite protection, git tracking for both source and destination, and edit logging
- **File Diff Tool** (`file_diff`) — compare two files with unified diff format showing
  additions/deletions, configurable context lines (default 3), change statistics, and context
  collapsing for readability

#### Enhanced File Tools

- **Enhanced File Read** (`file_read_enhanced`) — advanced file reader with automatic language
  detection (40+ languages including TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, etc.), smart binary file
  detection (by extension and content analysis), large file warnings (>1MB) with chunked reading
  suggestions, improved metadata display (file size, line count, language), and better error
  handling with specific error codes

### Fixed

- **Tool call JSON leaking during streaming** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — tool calls split across
  multiple WebSocket chunks now properly buffered and stripped; prevents incomplete JSON fragments
  like `{"tool":"web_search"...` from appearing in UI during live streaming before page refresh

### Improved

- **Tool registration** — computer tool now registered in all entry points: CLI chat
  (`src/cli/chat.ts`), WebSocket server (`src/server/ws.ts`), service processes
  (`src/processes/service-entry.ts`), and sub-agent processes (`src/processes/sub-agent-entry.ts`)
- **Import maps** (`deno.json`) — added `@std/encoding/base64` dependency for screenshot base64
  encoding with proper submodule mapping for Deno's module resolution
- **Security policy system** — extended `PolicyKind` type to include `computer` for fine-grained
  access control of computer use actions; all computer use operations now flow through policy
  validation with automatic sensitive data detection
- **Configuration schema** — extended `CortexConfig` interface with `computerUse` settings including
  enable/disable toggle, display resolution, runtime selection, screenshot options, and approval
  requirements; all settings persisted in main config file
- All tools now include structured `errorInfo` with error codes (`INVALID_URL`, `HTTP_ERROR`,
  `TIMEOUT`, etc.), retry flags, suggested actions, and context data
- Consistent retry logic across network-dependent tools (2-3 attempts with exponential backoff and
  configurable delays)
- Better error messages throughout the tool system with specific guidance on resolution
- Enhanced content extraction in web fetch with improved HTML stripping and markdown formatting
- Workspace tool exports updated to include new file management tools
- Settings UI now includes Tools & APIs tab and Computer Use tab for easy configuration management
- WebSocket chunk handling now uses buffering to prevent split tool calls from leaking through

#### Reasoning Inspection & Tool Call Improvements

- **Reasoning inspection panel** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — new `🔬 Reasoning` toggle button appears
  during agent operations when tools are used; clicking reveals a collapsible panel showing raw tool
  calls, execution results, and agent decision-making; panel auto-hides when response completes for
  a clean default UX
- **Real-time incremental streaming** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — chunks now emit to client as they
  arrive during buffered streaming mode, eliminating delays from full-response buffering; maintains
  ability to parse tool calls while providing live UI updates for multi-round tool execution flows

#### Structured Logging & Observability

- **Logger registry** (`src/utils/logger.ts`) — configurable logging system with pluggable
  transports (console, file, OTLP), per-namespace log levels, and structured JSON output
- **File transport** — warning-level and above written to `~/.cortex/data/cortex.log` by default;
  all levels written when verbose mode configured
- **`cortex log` CLI** (`src/cli/log-cmd.ts`) — `show`, `tail`, `clear`, `set-level`, `path`, and
  `status` subcommands for log management from the terminal
- **Logging settings UI** — new Logging tab in Settings with controls for level (debug/trace), file
  logging toggle, rotation settings, OTLP endpoint, Grafana dashboard link, and Langfuse
- **Langfuse tracing** (`src/observability/langfuse.ts`) — trace per agent turn, generation span per
  LLM round with token usage metrics, span per tool call with input/output capture
- **OTLP export** (`src/observability/otel.ts`) — OpenTelemetry trace/span export compatible with
  Grafana Tempo, Jaeger, and other OTLP receivers
- **Settings persistence** — `PUT /api/config` applies logging configuration changes live without
  requiring a server restart
- **Observability docs** (`docs/observability.md`) — comprehensive guide covering log levels,
  configuration, CLI commands, namespaces, OTLP setup, and Langfuse integration

#### Provider & Model Management

- **Configurable model pricing** — every provider now accepts an optional `pricing` config map that
  overrides built-in defaults; pricing visible in `cortex models show`; all 22 providers wired
- **Provider context windows** (`src/llm/router.ts`) — `PROVIDER_DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` export for
  dynamic context window lookup per provider, preventing silent truncation
- **Individual message deletion** — `DELETE /api/sessions/:id/messages/:messageId` endpoint for
  removing specific messages from a session with real-time UI delete button on hover

#### Web UI — Navigation & Pages

- **Projects page** — CRUD management for workspace projects with name, description, and agent
  assignment; stats bar with project count
- **Hooks page** — pipeline hook management with enable/disable toggles, stage selection, and
  admin-only visibility controls
- **Triggers page** — trigger management with cron/GitHub/file-watch type selectors, directory/file
  pattern fields, branch filters, and enabled toggles
- **Channels page** — channel adapter configuration with type selectors (Discord), API token fields,
  enable/disable toggles, and admin-only flags
- **Marketplace card redesign** — new `.card-mp` CSS with colour-derived icons, hover lift
  animations, version badges, monospace slugs, and green "installed" detection badges
- **Marketplace plugin version enrichment** — proxy checks GitHub releases/tags for real version
  numbers with 1-hour cache; installed plugins/agents detected via API and shown with green badges
- **Activity page enhanced** — replaced separate Logs page with unified Activity view featuring
  level filter (errors/warnings), line limit selector (50/100/200/500), auto-refresh toggle, actor
  column, and inline error formatting
- **SVG banner** — new banner with CortexPrism logo, title, tagline, and version badges added to
  README and docs

### Fixed

- **Tool call JSON leaking into responses** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — replaced fragile regex pattern
  with robust brace-depth walker algorithm that properly handles nested JSON, escaped characters,
  and string boundaries; correctly strips `{"tool":...,"args":{...}}` patterns of arbitrary depth
- **Missing output after tool execution** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — multi-turn tool execution (search
  → synthesis) now shows final response in real-time without requiring page refresh; incremental
  streaming sends chunks immediately instead of waiting for full buffering
- **Tool call JSON persisted to database** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — responses are now stripped of
  tool calls before storage in session history, ensuring clean session records and past
  conversations remain readable and professional
- **Duplicate `reasoningBtn` variable declaration** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — renamed second `const`
  declaration to `reasoningBtnToggle` to fix `SyntaxError: Identifier has already been declared`;
  nested `case` blocks in a `switch` share the same scope
- **Reasoning panel showing raw XML/tool calls** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — panel now extracts only
  reasoning content via regex instead of displaying unfiltered `capturedReasoning` with structured
  tool calls and markup tags
- **Reasoning panel persisting across messages** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — panel DOM element now
  properly removed via `.remove()` on `case 'start'` instead of only hidden with `display: none`
- **Reasoning panel force-closed on response completion** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — removed unnecessary
  `reasoningPanelOpen = false` and panel hide in `case 'done'` so user maintains control over panel
  visibility
- **`cortex restart` port conflict** — uses `fuser -k <port>/tcp` to kill actual server process
  instead of shell wrapper, fixing `AddrInUse` on restart

### Changed

- **Tool call handling strategy** (`src/server/ws.ts`, `src/agent/loop.ts`) — captured all raw
  reasoning separately from cleaned output; reasoning sent to client as optional 'reasoning' message
  type; WebSocket handler double-checks stripping with brace-depth walker for defensive consistency
- **Logs page merged into Activity** — removed separate Logs page and consolidated into enhanced
  Activity page with level filtering, line limits, auto-refresh, and actor column
- **USER.md format requirements** — documented format expectations in soul.ts for consistent UI
  parsing

---

## [0.33.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Plugin update system** (`src/plugins/update.ts`) — checks for new plugin versions via GitHub
  Releases API with automatic fallback to the Tags API for repos that tag commits directly without
  creating a formal Release; semver tags (`vX.Y.Z` / `X.Y.Z`) are preferred
- **`PluginUpdateConfig`** (`src/config/config.ts`) — new config block `pluginUpdate` with fields
  `checkOnStartup`, `autoUpdate`, `checkIntervalHours`, and `githubToken`; deep-merged on load so
  defaults are never lost when upgrading from an older config file
- **Plugin update startup check & scheduler** (`src/cli/daemon.ts`) — on daemon start, checks all
  installed plugins for updates; if `autoUpdate` is enabled applies them automatically; periodic
  re-checks are scheduled via `schedulePluginUpdateChecks`
- **`GET /api/plugins/check-updates`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — returns per-plugin version status
  (current, latest, updateAvailable, error) using `pluginUpdate.githubToken` from config
- **`POST /api/plugins/update-all`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — applies all available plugin updates
  and returns per-plugin success/error detail
- **Plugin Updates settings card** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — new card in the Updates settings pane with
  interval, GitHub token (with PAT generation link), startup and auto-update checkboxes, and **Save
  Plugin Settings**, **Check Now**, and **Update All** action buttons with inline results panel
- **Provider-specific LLM settings** (`src/config/config.ts`, `src/llm/types.ts`,
  `src/llm/openai-compatible.ts`, `src/llm/ollama.ts`, `src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`) —
  each provider now exposes its unique parameters end-to-end from config → `CompletionOptions` →
  provider adapter:
  - **Anthropic / Google / OpenAI** — `reasoningEffort` (low / medium / high) already wired; now
    surfaced as a labelled dropdown in the Edit modal ("Extended Thinking", "Thinking Budget",
    "Reasoning Effort")
  - **OpenRouter** — `httpReferer` and `xTitle` injected as `HTTP-Referer` / `X-Title` request
    headers
  - **Perplexity** — `searchRecencyFilter` (month / week / day / hour), `returnCitations`,
    `returnImages` forwarded as `search_recency_filter`, `return_citations`, `return_images` body
    fields
  - **Together AI / Fireworks / Novita** — `repetitionPenalty` forwarded as `repetition_penalty`
  - **Ollama** — `numCtx` → `num_ctx`, `numThread` → `num_thread` in `options` object; `keepAlive` →
    `keep_alive` at request-body level; both `complete()` and `stream()` wired
  - **LM Studio** — `numCtx`, `keepAlive` forwarded via the OpenAI-compatible path
  - **LiteLLM** — `dropParams` → `drop_params` body field to silently ignore unsupported parameters
  - **Venice AI** — `includeVeniceSystemPrompt` → `venice_parameters.include_venice_system_prompt`
- **`PROVIDER_EXTRA_FIELDS` metadata** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — declarative per-provider field
  descriptor map (`select` / `number` / `text` / `checkbox`) that drives a dynamic "Provider
  Settings" section injected into the Add/Edit Model modal when a provider with extra fields is
  selected
- **Provider card summary badges** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — configured provider cards in Settings now
  display active extra settings inline (reasoning effort, repetition penalty, recency filter,
  num_ctx, keep-alive, citations, drop-params, venice-prompt)
- **`PUT /api/config/provider` body widened** (`src/server/router.ts`) — accepts all new
  provider-specific fields so the modal save correctly persists them
- **11 new LLM providers** — Cerebras, Fireworks, Perplexity, NVIDIA NIM, Moonshot (Kimi), Novita
  AI, LM Studio, LiteLLM, Hugging Face Inference Router, Alibaba (Qwen), and Venice AI; each
  implemented as an `OpenAICompatibleProvider` subclass with verified base URLs and auth from
  official docs (`src/llm/cerebras.ts`, `fireworks.ts`, `perplexity.ts`, `nvidia.ts`, `moonshot.ts`,
  `novita.ts`, `lmstudio.ts`, `litellm.ts`, `huggingface.ts`, `alibaba.ts`, `venice.ts`)
- **Model listing for all new providers** (`src/server/models.ts`) — dedicated `*Models()` functions
  registered in the `LISTERS` map; Perplexity falls back to a static curated list as it exposes no
  `/models` endpoint
- **Dynamic provider + model selects in agent modal** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — agent create/edit modal
  now populates providers from `/api/providers/configured` (only keys with API key set) and
  auto-fetches models for the chosen provider via `onAgentProviderChange()`
- **`GET /api/providers/configured`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — returns only providers that have an
  API key (or `baseUrl` for Ollama) configured, used by the agent modal and QM settings
- **Quartermaster unified page** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — merged the former separate "Quartermaster"
  and "Model Intel" nav items into a single page with **Tool Orchestration** and **Model
  Intelligence** section tabs plus a ⚙ settings panel
- **QM Settings panel** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — inline settings to
  enable/disable Model Intelligence, pin a dedicated QM provider + model (ideal for Ollama/LM
  Studio), choose strategy (conservative / balanced / aggressive), and set the observe threshold;
  saved via `POST /api/qm/config`
- **`GET/POST /api/qm/config`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — read and write `modelSelection` config
  block including new `quartermasterProvider` and `quartermasterModel` fields
- **`POST /api/qm/reset`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — clears all learned QM patterns, decisions,
  tool stats, and signal weights
- **`GET /api/qm/patterns`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — dedicated endpoint for learned tool-sequence
  patterns, replacing the patterns tab's reuse of `/api/qm/health`
- **QM patterns tab rework** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — now pulls real pattern rows (tool sequence,
  hit/success counts, avg confidence) from `/api/qm/patterns`; renders a progress bar per pattern
- **QM decisions tab rework** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — shows aggregate accuracy header, signal
  contribution per decision, session suffix, and pending-evaluation count
- **First-time password setup** (`src/server/router.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`) —
  `POST /api/auth/change-password` now skips session auth when no password exists yet; settings
  Security tab dynamically shows "Set Password" vs "Change Password" and hides the current-password
  field on first use; a new session cookie is returned immediately after the password is set
- **`quartermasterProvider` / `quartermasterModel` config fields** (`src/config/config.ts`) —
  optional fields on `ModelSelectionConfig` to pin model routing to a specific provider
- **Request-flow architecture doc** (`docs/request-flow.md`) — Mermaid flowchart covering the full
  lifecycle of a user message through pipeline hooks, metacognition, hybrid memory, LLM rounds, tool
  execution, sub-agents, reflection, and output streaming
- **Memory health CLI** (`src/cli/memory-cmd.ts`) — `cortex memory health` prints per-tier stats
  (total, active, stale counts; avg decay, importance, and access frequency) for episodic, semantic,
  graph, and reflection memory with colour-coded decay indicators
- **Memory heuristics CLI** (`src/cli/memory-cmd.ts`) — `cortex memory heuristics` manually triggers
  a full heuristic learning cycle and reports rows affected per pass (importance boosted, decay
  slowed, relations strengthened, auto-tagged)
- **`updated_at` on `episodic_memory`** (`src/db/migrations/020_episodic_updated_at.sql`) — adds the
  missing column (backfilled from `created_at`) that hourly consolidation was silently failing to
  write; also registers the six missing `graph_relation_types` rows (`related_to`, `is_part_of`,
  `is_instance_of`, `contradicts`, `supports`, `causes`)
- **Server log file** (`src/cli/serve.ts`, `src/config/paths.ts`) — background server process now
  redirects all stdout/stderr to `~/.cortex/data/server.log` (appending across restarts) via a shell
  redirect, replacing the previous silent `/dev/null` discard; `PATHS.serverLog` exposes the
  canonical path
- **Agent loop debug tracing** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — `[loop]` prefixed `console.log` statements on
  every tool round: turn ID, tool presence, stream mode, response length/preview, detected tool call
  names, per-tool execution results (success, output length, error), prose emission length, and
  final response emission path

### Fixed

- **Plugin auto-update HTML parse crash** (`src/plugins/update.ts`) — `applyPluginUpdate` was
  fetching the GitHub repo homepage URL as a JSON manifest, receiving HTML and crashing with
  `Unexpected token '<'`; GitHub-sourced plugins now download the archive tarball at the resolved
  tag (`refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`) instead
- **Direct URL fallback skips GitHub URLs** (`src/plugins/update.ts`) — the manifest re-fetch
  fallback in `checkUpdateForRow` now excludes `github.com` URLs, which are exclusively handled by
  the Releases/Tags API path
- **`githubToken` threaded through `applyPluginUpdate`** (`src/plugins/update.ts`,
  `src/cli/daemon.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — token is now passed to the internal
  `checkUpdateForRow` call, preventing unauthenticated GitHub API rate-limit failures that caused
  fallthrough to the HTML fetch path
- **Route ordering for `/api/plugins/check-updates`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — moved specific
  routes before the `GET /api/plugins/:name` catch-all which was intercepting them and returning 404
- **Daily semantic decay was a no-op** (`src/memory/consolidate.ts`) — `runDailyConsolidation`
  queried the non-existent column `last_accessed_at`; corrected to `last_accessed` (the actual
  schema column), so decay scores are now updated on every daily cycle
- **Heuristic cycle metrics always reported zero** (`src/memory/heuristics.ts`) —
  `boostImportanceFromAccess` and `slowDecayForFrequentAccess` both hardcoded `return 0`; they now
  use `db.client.execute` to obtain `rowsAffected` and return the real updated-row count
- **Half-life extension only fired once** (`src/memory/heuristics.ts`) —
  `slowDecayForFrequentAccess` guarded with `half_life_days <= default`, preventing re-triggering
  after the first extension; changed to `< max` so frequently-accessed memories keep extending
  toward the ceiling on each cycle
- **Reflection patterns duplicated on every turn** (`src/agent/reflect.ts`) — `storeReflection` used
  `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with a random ID, so the same pattern string accumulated hundreds of
  rows; it now looks up by `pattern` text first and performs a weighted confidence update +
  `supporting_events` increment on existing rows, only inserting when the pattern is genuinely new
- **Memory injection missing metadata context** (`src/memory/inject.ts`) — `formatHit` only showed
  label and age; it now also surfaces `category`, `tags`, `topics`, and `entities` inline so the LLM
  receives richer context for each recalled memory
- **Noisy knowledge graph entities** (`src/memory/graph.ts`) — `extractAndStoreEntities` was
  creating graph nodes for every capitalized word (e.g. "User", "Assistant", "Based", "String"); an
  `ENTITY_STOP_WORDS` set now filters common English words and agent-specific noise before insertion
- **Bare JSON tool calls leaked to chat UI** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — `stripToolCallMarkup` used a
  non-greedy regex `\{...\}` that stopped at the first `}`, so nested args like
  `{"tool":"file_read","args":{"path":"..."}}` were only partially removed and the remainder was
  rendered in the UI; replaced with the same brace-depth walker used by `extractBareToolCalls`,
  collecting full-span regions right-to-left before removal
- **Tool call JSON leaked to chat UI** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — round 0 previously streamed the raw
  LLM response (including `{"tool":"...","args":{...}}` JSON or `<tool_call>` XML) directly to
  `onChunk` before tool call detection ran; all rounds now use a buffered internal `stream()` call
  when tools are registered, and only clean prose is forwarded to the client
- **`<tool_result>` XML leaked to chat UI** (`src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`) — raw
  `<tool_result ...>` XML blocks were forwarded via `onChunk` after each tool execution; the
  `onChunk` call for tool results is removed, and the `ws.ts` `onChunk` handler now strips
  `<tool_call>`, `<tool_result>`, and bare JSON tool objects as a client-side safety net
- **Duplicate tool call execution** (`src/tools/executor.ts`) — `parseToolCalls` ran both the
  `<tool_call>` XML regex and `extractBareToolCalls` on the same text, causing every
  `<tool_call>{"tool":...}</tool_call>` to be parsed and executed twice; fixed by stripping XML
  regions from the text before the bare JSON scan
- **LLM hang on tool follow-up rounds** (`src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/llm/openai-compatible.ts`,
  `src/llm/types.ts`) — tool follow-up rounds used `complete()` which stalled indefinitely on slow
  providers (DeepSeek) when given large contexts; all tool rounds now use buffered `stream()` with a
  90-second `AbortSignal` timeout; `signal?: AbortSignal` added to `CompletionOptions` and wired
  through `OpenAICompatibleProvider.stream()` and `complete()`
- **Model looping on tools without producing a final answer** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — follow-up
  prompt after tool results now escalates per round: when ≤1 rounds remain the model receives a hard
  instruction to stop calling tools and deliver its final response immediately

---

## [0.32.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Voice & TTS system** (`src/voice/`, `src/tools/builtin/speak.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/listen.ts`,
  `src/cli/voice-cmd.ts`) — full voice pipeline: speech-to-text via OpenAI Whisper, text-to-speech
  via OpenAI TTS (or optional ElevenLabs), energy-based VAD, audio format conversion with ffmpeg
  fallback, voice channel plugin implementing `ChannelPlugin`, and `speak`/`listen` agent tools
- **Voice WebSocket protocol** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — new `WsMsg` variants (`audio_chunk`,
  `audio_end`, `speak`, `audio`, `voice_state`) for real-time audio streaming, server-side
  transcription, and TTS playback; transcribed speech is dispatched directly into the agent loop
- **Voice API routes** (`POST /api/voice/transcribe`, `POST /api/voice/synthesize`,
  `GET /api/voice/synthesize/:text`, `GET /api/voice/providers`) — REST endpoints for audio
  transcription and speech synthesis
- **Auto-TTS pipeline hook** (`src/voice/pipeline.ts`) — `post-output` hook that automatically
  synthesizes agent text responses to audio when `voice.autoTTS` is enabled; audio is forwarded to
  the WebSocket client before the `done` signal
- **Voice settings in Web UI** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — Voice & TTS settings tab with provider
  selection, default voice, language, auto-TTS toggle, and ElevenLabs API key; microphone button in
  chat input bar with CSS recording animation; speaker button on each assistant message for
  on-demand TTS; voice indicator with speaking pulse animation
- **Voice activity detection** (`src/voice/vad.ts`) — energy-based VAD with configurable frame size,
  speech threshold, silence timeout, and minimum speech duration
- **Voice CLI command** (`cortex voice enable|disable|status|set-voice`) — manage voice mode and
  default voice from the terminal
- **`voiceDataDir` path** (`src/config/paths.ts`) — dedicated voice cache directory under the data
  directory
- **Service management commands** (`src/cli/start.ts`) — `cortex start` and `cortex restart`
  commands for managing the daemon and web UI server processes
- **Silent install and uninstall operations** (`src/cli/install.ts`, `src/cli/service-helper.ts`) —
  `--yes` flags and non-interactive mode for automated setup scripts
- **macOS launchd `HOME` fix** (`src/cli/daemon.ts`, `src/cli/serve.ts`, `src/utils/platform.ts`) —
  launchd plist now writes the correct `HOME` value from environment instead of requiring a manual
  placeholder edit

- **Web UI file upload** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`) — attach
  files (PDFs, images, documents) directly in the chat input bar via a new 📎 button. Files are sent
  as base64 over WebSocket alongside chat messages, saved to both the working directory and agent
  workspace for tool access, and displayed as inline previews in the chat log
- **Multimodal content types** (`src/llm/types.ts`) — `Message.content` now supports
  `ContentBlock[]` (text, image, document) in addition to plain strings, enabling multimodal LLM
  providers to receive images and documents natively
- **Multimodal LLM provider support** — Anthropic (`src/llm/anthropic.ts`) maps content blocks to
  native `image`/`document` blocks; OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible providers (`src/llm/openai.ts`,
  `src/llm/openai-compatible.ts`) map images to `image_url` parts; Google (`src/llm/google.ts`) maps
  to `inlineData` parts; Ollama (`src/llm/ollama.ts`) maps images to the `images` array; Bedrock
  (`src/llm/bedrock.ts`) extracts text from content blocks for Converse API
- **PDF text extraction** (`src/utils/pdf.ts`) — new utility using `pdf-parse` (PDF.js) to extract
  readable text from uploaded PDFs. Integrated into `file_read` tool
  (`src/tools/builtin/file_read.ts`) for on-demand extraction, and into the WebSocket handler for
  immediate inline preview in the chat message
- **Upload endpoint** (`POST /api/upload`) — REST endpoint for programmatic file uploads, accepts
  `{ filename, mimeType, data (base64) }` and saves to `$DATA_DIR/uploads/`
- **Session resume on page refresh** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — `processChatMessage` now accepts and
  reuses the client-provided `sessionId` from WebSocket chat messages, so page refresh resumes the
  existing conversation (with full history) instead of creating a new session
- **Text-only model image handling** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — image content blocks are only sent to
  providers known to support multimodal input (Anthropic, Google); for other providers a clear
  message is appended noting the limitation and suggesting a provider switch, with the file saved to
  disk for reference
- **Raw tool call filtering in session restore** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — `restoreSession()` now
  detects assistant messages containing raw `{"tool":...}` JSON and renders them as compact
  `⚙ tool_name` bubbles instead of displaying the raw JSON verbatim
- **Uploaded files written to both working directory and agent workspace** (`src/server/ws.ts`) —
  ensures `file_read` and `file_list` tools can find the file regardless of which workspace root
  they resolve to
- **`web_fetch` tool** (`src/tools/builtin/web_fetch.ts`) — fetch any URL and return cleaned plain
  text (strips HTML, scripts, and styles). Supports configurable max length
- **`file_glob` tool** (`src/tools/builtin/workspace/file_glob.ts`) — find files matching glob
  patterns (e.g. `**/*.ts`, `*.pdf`). Returns relative paths sorted by modification time, respects
  `workspace: "agent"/"global"` parameter
- **`shell` tool wired in** (`src/tools/builtin/shell.ts`, `src/server/ws.ts`) — local shell command
  execution tool was already built but not registered; now wired into the default tool set with
  safety filtering against destructive commands

### Changed

- **Agent loop** (`src/agent/loop.ts`) — `AgentTurnOptions` now accepts optional `userContentBlocks`
  for multimodal user messages; when provided, the last user message in history is replaced with
  content blocks so the LLM receives the full multimodal context. After tool execution, a follow-up
  instruction is embedded in the tool result message (_"Based on the tool output above, provide your
  complete response. Do NOT make additional tool calls unless absolutely necessary"_) to force the
  LLM to produce analysis rather than stopping after raw tool output
- **LLM router** (`src/llm/router.ts`) — `chooseModel()` updated to extract text from
  `ContentBlock[]` for scoring, maintaining compatibility with multimodal messages
- **`file_read` tool** (`src/tools/builtin/file_read.ts`) — added `workspace` parameter
  (`"agent"/"global"`) matching other file tools; path resolution now uses `resolveWorkspacePath()`
  to find files in the agent workspace; PDF output capped at 150 lines / 8000 chars to avoid context
  exhaustion; description prominently mentions PDF auto-extraction
- **`code_exec` tool description** (`src/tools/builtin/code_exec.ts`) — now explicitly warns that
  the sandbox has NO access to host files or workspace, no package managers available
- **System prompt augmentations** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — two new sections appended:
  - `## File Context` — tells the agent uploaded content is included inline and to analyze it
    directly without calling `file_read` unless necessary
  - `## Environment` — warns that `code_exec` runs in an isolated Docker sandbox with no host
    filesystem access; use file tools for all file operations
- **PDF inline preview** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — extracted text wrapped in
  `=== BEGIN/END DOCUMENT ===` markers; preview capped at 2000 chars to keep initial context lean;
  when extraction fails, an explicit `file_read("filename.pdf")` hint is included
- **File-upload prompt** (`src/server/ws.ts`) — when files are uploaded without a text message, the
  effective prompt is now explicitly directive: _"Read, analyze, and provide a thorough evaluation —
  include: Summary of key content, Main points and findings, Your assessment and any
  recommendations"_

### Fixed

- **PDF extraction silent failure** (`src/utils/pdf.ts`) — `pdf-parse` was receiving `Buffer.from()`
  when it requires `Uint8Array` in Deno, causing silent extraction failures. Fixed by passing the
  raw `Uint8Array` directly
- **`code_exec` Docker filesystem blindness** — agent was running `find /`, `strings`, `pip install`
  in the Docker sandbox which has no host filesystem access, wasting tool rounds. Fixed by adding
  warnings to both the `code_exec` tool description and the system prompt `## Environment` section
- **Tool output displayed without analysis** — after `file_read` returned PDF text, the agent would
  stop without producing a natural language analysis. Fixed by embedding a follow-up instruction
  directly in the tool result user message and telling the agent to analyze inline content directly
  rather than re-reading it via tools

---

## [0.31.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Unified service installation** (`src/cli/install.ts`) — `cortex install` and `cortex uninstall`
  top-level commands that install both the daemon supervisor and web UI server as system services in
  a single step
- **Server service installation** (`src/cli/serve.ts`) — `cortex serve install` and
  `cortex serve uninstall` subcommands for installing only the web UI server as a system service
- **`--with-server` flag** (`src/cli/daemon.ts`) — `cortex daemon install --with-server` installs
  both the daemon and server services together
- **Shared service helper** (`src/cli/service-helper.ts`) — cross-platform service management module
  generating systemd user units (Linux), launchd agents (macOS), and NSSM/Task Scheduler
  instructions (Windows) for both daemon and server, with correct per-platform binary path and home
  directory resolution
- **Server service templates** — `deploy/cortex-server.service` (systemd user unit) and
  `deploy/com.cortexprism.server.plist` (launchd agent) for manual deployment
- **Extended Windows installer** (`deploy/install-service.bat`) — now installs both daemon and
  server with `--daemon-only`/`--server-only` flags for selective installation via NSSM or Task
  Scheduler

### Changed

- **Daemon service install** (`src/cli/daemon.ts`) — refactored to use shared service helper; macOS
  launchd plist now writes the correct `HOME` value from environment instead of requiring a manual
  placeholder edit
- **macOS launchd agent** (`deploy/com.cortexprism.plist`) — now dynamically writes `HOME`
  environment variable at install time

## [0.30.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Windows path resolution** — All `import.meta.url` pathname usages replaced with `fromFileUrl`
  from `@std/path` to fix broken `/C:/Users/...` paths on Windows (affects db migrations, update
  installer, version detection, daemon spawning, and sub-agent/service spawning)
- **Windows path separators** — Hardcoded `/` path concatenation replaced with `join()`/`dirname()`
  in server router, plugins context, inline SPA UI code, file watcher, and plugin install
- **Windows process management** — Added cross-platform `findDenoProcesses()`,
  `killDenoProcesses()`, `killProcessById()`, and `killChildProcess()` helpers with PowerShell
  fallbacks on Windows. Replaced all `pgrep`, `pkill`, and direct `SIGTERM` usages across CLI
  commands, agent sub-processes, service manager, and daemon supervisor
- **Windows shell execution** — Hardcoded `sh` commands replaced with `getShellCommand()` which uses
  PowerShell on Windows (executor process, scheduler process, jobs CLI)
- **Windows temp directory** — Hardcoded `/tmp/cortex` socket directory replaced with `getTempDir()`
  fallback. Screenshot temp paths also fixed
- **Windows home directory** — `Deno.env.get('HOME')` without `USERPROFILE` fallback in plugins and
  import/migration CLI commands replaced with centralized `resolveHomeDir()`
- **Windows editor default** — `vi` fallback in soul-cmd replaced with `notepad` on Windows
- **Workflow engine** — `df` and `free` Unix commands wrapped in try/catch for Windows compatibility
- **Workspace path validation** — `startsWith('/')` replaced with `isAbsolute()` for correct
  detection of Windows absolute paths (e.g., `D:\...`); container check handles both `\` and `/`
- **Server stability** — `Deno.serve()` result awaited with error handler to prevent silent crash on
  port bind failure; daemon child process stderr piped for error visibility; missed `SIGTERM` in
  serve restart flow replaced with `killProcessById()`
- **libSQL database** — `file:` URL backslashes normalized to forward slashes for Windows
  compatibility
- **Test suite** — Cross-platform fixes for workspace tests: `fromFileUrl` for SQL migration paths,
  `join()` for path assertions, `isAbsolute()` for path containment checks, delay after db close for
  Windows file-locking

## [0.30.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Cross-platform support (macOS & Windows)** — CortexPrism now runs natively on all three major
  platforms alongside existing Linux support:
  - **Platform detection utility** (`src/utils/platform.ts`) — `isWindows()`, `isMacOS()`,
    `isLinux()`, `getShellCommand()`, `getExeSuffix()` helpers used throughout the codebase
  - **Cross-platform shell execution** (`src/tools/builtin/shell.ts`) — PowerShell on Windows
    (`-NoProfile -Command`), `sh` on Unix. Expanded safety filter with Windows-specific blocked
    commands (`del /f /s /q C:\`, `format`, `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`)
  - **Cross-platform file permissions** (`src/utils/permissions.ts`) — `makeExecutable()` and
    `makePrivate()` abstractions that are no-ops on Windows, `chmod` on Unix. All `Deno.chmod()`
    call sites migrated
  - **Windows home directory resolution** (`src/config/paths.ts`) — `HOMEDRIVE`/`HOMEPATH` fallback
    in addition to `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`
  - **Cross-platform sandbox runners** (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`) — `.exe` suffixed binaries on
    Windows, platform-aware `killProcess()` helper (SIGTERM on Unix, bare kill on Windows),
    platform-specific Docker Desktop installation messages
  - **Cross-platform git hooks** (`src/triggers/git-hooks.ts`) — `$(date -Iseconds)` replaced with
    Deno-generated ISO timestamps
  - **Cross-platform update installer** (`src/update/installer.ts`) — `powershell Expand-Archive`
    for zip extraction on Windows, `tar.exe` on Windows, `getExeSuffix()` for binary naming

- **Desktop automation — macOS** (`src/desktop/darwin.ts`) — `screencapture` for screenshots,
  `osascript` for keystrokes, `pbpaste`/`pbcopy` for clipboard, `cliclick` for mouse actions and
  drags. Full `DesktopAutomation` interface implementation

- **Desktop automation — Windows** (`src/desktop/windows.ts`) — PowerShell + .NET
  `System.Windows.Forms`/`System.Drawing` for screenshots, mouse positioning, clicks, drags,
  keystrokes, and clipboard. Full `DesktopAutomation` interface implementation

- **Desktop automation abstraction** (`src/desktop/types.ts`) — `DesktopAutomation` interface with
  `executeDesktopAction()`, `getDockerfile()`, `getEntrypointScript()`. Platform-dispatching facade
  in `src/desktop/automation.ts` selects the correct implementation at runtime via `Deno.build.os`

- **Daemon service installation** (`src/cli/daemon.ts`) — `cortex daemon install` and
  `cortex daemon uninstall` commands for all platforms:
  - **Linux**: `systemctl --user` via `~/.config/systemd/user/cortex-daemon.service`
  - **macOS**: `launchctl load/unload` via `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cortexprism.daemon.plist`
  - **Windows**: NSSM-based service or directs to `deploy/install-service.bat`

- **Deployment configs** — `deploy/cortex-daemon.service` (systemd user unit),
  `deploy/com.cortexprism.plist` (launchd agent), `deploy/install-service.bat` (Windows NSSM/Task
  Scheduler setup)

- **CI/CD expansion** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`) — Test matrix
  expanded to `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`. Tauri build job added with platform
  matrix (deb/dmg/msi)

- **Platform documentation** — `docs/install/macos.md`, `docs/install/windows.md`,
  `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` (feature parity matrix across all platforms)

- **Windows installer** (`install.ps1`) — PowerShell-based installer: clones repo, installs Deno if
  missing, creates `cortex.bat` wrapper, adds to user PATH

- **Package distribution manifests** — Homebrew formula (`packaging/homebrew/cortex.rb`), Chocolatey
  nuspec + install script (`packaging/chocolatey/`), Scoop bucket (`packaging/scoop/cortex.json`),
  winget manifest (`packaging/winget/`)

- **Code signing guide** (`packaging/CODE_SIGNING.md`) — macOS codesign/notarization + Windows
  signtool instructions for desktop app distribution

### Changed

- Desktop automation refactored from single Linux-only `automation.ts` to platform-dispatching
  architecture with three independent implementations sharing a common `DesktopAutomation`
  interface. Public API (`executeDesktopAction`, `getDockerfile`, `getEntrypointScript`) unchanged
  for backward compatibility

### Fixed

- **macOS screenshot args** — `screencapture` format flag was duplicated in argv. Fixed to pass
  single `-t png`/`-t jpg`
- **macOS keypress** — Changed from `key code` (numeric codes only) to `keystroke` with AppleScript
  `using {modifiers}` syntax for proper key name support

## [0.29.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Dashboard as default landing page** — Dashboard now opens first on load instead of Chat,
  providing an immediate system overview. Dashboard moved from "Monitoring" to "Core" nav section
  with active-state highlighting on load.
- **Navigation consolidation** — Removed standalone Status page; all Status content (system
  overview, KPI cards, daemon status, system resources, activity feed) merged into the Dashboard as
  configurable widgets. Sidebar simplified with Dashboard as the primary Core entry.
- **Three new Dashboard widgets** covering the old Status page functionality:
  - **Server Info** (2×1) — Uptime, LLM Provider/Model, Cortex Build version, System Status
  - **Enhanced System Resources** (2×2, up from 2×1) — Memory/Disk bars plus CPU Cores and Platform
    panels
  - **Enhanced Daemon Status** (2×2, up from 1×1) — Detailed daemon cards with status dots,
    descriptions, online count, and operational-status warning banner
- **Dashboard Config REST API** (`GET`/`PUT /api/dashboard/config`) — Persists widget layout to
  `~/.cortex/dashboard.json`, enabling programmatic dashboard manipulation
- **`dashboard_manage` LLM tool** — Agent-accessible tool for CRUD operations on dashboard widgets
  directly through chat. Supports `list`, `add`, `remove`, and `update` operations. Registered in
  all four execution contexts (CLI chat, WebSocket/dashboard chat, services, sub-agents).
- **Custom HTML widget type** — LLM agents can craft fully custom dashboard widgets with arbitrary
  HTML and inline CSS via the `dashboard_manage` tool. Supports optional `title` override and
  `refresh` interval (min 5s). Script tags and event handlers are stripped for safety. Hidden from
  the manual UI widget picker (agent-only creation).

### Changed

- **Default dashboard layout** reconfigured to 8 widgets: KPI Cards, Server Info, Daemon Status
  (2-row), Memory Stats, System Resources (2-row), Recent Sessions (2-row), Token Chart, and Recent
  Activity
- **Memory Stats widget** widened from 1×1 to 2×1 for better readability
- **Command palette** (Ctrl+K) entry for Status merged into Dashboard entry

### Fixed

- **Drag-and-drop in Dashboard** — Fixed swap logic to exchange widget positions in the array
  instead of invisible `row`/`col` metadata fields, which previously produced zero visual change
  because CSS grid auto-flow follows array order, not metadata
- **Drag-start prevention** — Strengthened edit-mode guard by setting `effectAllowed = "none"` in
  addition to `preventDefault()` for browsers that ignore `preventDefault` on `dragstart`

## [0.28.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Soul system expansion** — Overhauled agent identity system with richer defaults, more
  personality options, and new CLI commands:
  - **Expanded DEFAULT_SOUL** — Now 10 sections (Identity, Behavior, Output Format, Tool Usage,
    Memory, Sub-Agents, Safety & Ethics, Learning & Adaptation, Limitations) with detailed
    behavioral guidance for tool usage, output formatting, and ethical conduct
  - **USER.md template** — Expanded with Goals & Objectives, Current Projects, Technical
    Environment, Communication preferences, and Learning Interests sections
  - **MEMORY.md template** — Restructured with About the User, Project Context, Key Decisions,
    Preferences, and Ongoing Work sections
  - **4 new personality templates** — Creative, Analyst, Teacher, and Minimalist, bringing the total
    to 7 personality options during setup
  - **`cortex soul templates`** — List all available personality templates with descriptions
  - **`cortex soul apply-template <name>`** — Apply a personality template to SOUL.md
  - **`cortex soul validate`** — Validate SOUL.md structure against recommended sections
  - **Template consolidation** — All personality templates centralized in `src/agent/soul.ts`,
    eliminating 3 duplicate copies across the codebase

### Changed

- **Soul fallback** — DEFAULT_SOUL runtime fallback kept concise (~15 lines) while the expanded
  template is used exclusively for file initialization, preventing behavioral regression for agents
  without a custom SOUL.md
- **Personality spelling** — Standardized on American English "Behavior" across all templates

### Fixed

- **Security**: Prototype-safe template name validation using `Object.hasOwn()` instead of `in`
  operator
- **Performance**: Replaced unnecessary dynamic imports with static imports in CLI and server

## [0.27.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Model Quartermaster — Intelligent LLM Selection System** (`src/model-quartermaster/`) — A
  learning-based model selection engine that dynamically routes requests to the most appropriate LLM
  based on task characteristics, historical performance, cost constraints, and learned patterns.
  Registered as a pipeline hook (`@cortex/model-quartermaster`, priority 5) at `pre-llm` and
  `post-llm` stages. Key components:
  - **6-signal prediction engine** — historical performance by task category, episodic memory hits,
    cost optimization, quality estimation, trajectory patterns (recent model usage), and reflection
    feedback are fused via weighted combination to predict the best model before each LLM call
  - **Three-mode decision system** — predictions above 0.85 confidence use `enforce` mode (override
    model selection); above 0.65 use `suggest` (hint injected to system prompt); otherwise `defer`
    to default provider
  - **Adaptive learning** — signal weights update via EMA (`new = old + lr × (reward - old)`) with
    decaying learning rate (0.05 → 0.995 decay), driven by quality and cost efficiency feedback
  - **Observation-first startup** — MQM starts in observe-only mode until 50 LLM calls are observed,
    then activates and begins making predictions
  - **Three arbiter strategies** — `conservative` (prefers cheaper models, high confidence
    required), `balanced` (standard thresholds for cost/quality balance), `aggressive` (prioritizes
    quality, lower thresholds)
  - **Task categorization** — Automatic classification of requests into `code`, `analysis`,
    `creative`, `factual`, or `conversation` categories using heuristic keyword matching
  - **Context fingerprinting** — Multi-feature context extraction (message length, code detection,
    question count, complexity estimation) for pattern matching and signal scoring
  - **SQLite schema** (`019_model_quartermaster.sql`) — 5 tables: `mqm_model_stats`,
    `mqm_signal_weights`, `mqm_decisions`, `mqm_session_state`, `mqm_patterns` with full audit trail
    per decision
  - **Lens audit events** — 5 new event types (`mqm_prediction`, `mqm_observation`,
    `mqm_weight_updated`, `mqm_pattern_learned`, `mqm_mode_changed`) logged for observability
  - **Configuration** — `modelSelection` config section in `cortex.json` with `enabled`, `mode`,
    `observeThreshold`, `enforceConfidence`, `suggestConfidence`, `costBudget`, `qualityThreshold`,
    and `allowedProviders` settings
  - **Pipeline integration** — New `pre-llm` and `post-llm` hook stages feed MQM predictions into
    the agent loop, with automatic provider/model override for enforce decisions

- **Server UI Quartermaster dashboard** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — New "Quartermaster" nav tab in the
  Monitoring section with three sub-tab panes:
  - **Overview** — 6 stat cards (mode badge, observations, predictions, correct, overall/recent
    accuracy), Chart.js line chart for accuracy trends (bucket + rolling average), horizontal signal
    weight bars with gradient fill, and grid of top-10 tool stats with color-coded success rate bars
  - **Patterns** — Session-level prediction accuracy grouped by session ID with bar charts and
    automate/suggest/defer mode breakdowns
  - **Decisions** — Reverse-chronological decision log with color-coded mode dots, predicted vs
    actual tool display, confidence percentages, signal names, and correctness indicators (✓/✗/⏳)
  - Fetches `/api/qm/health` and `/api/qm/recent` endpoints, follows existing `switchMemoryTab`
    sub-tab pattern, and auto-loads on nav click via `showPage()` loader dispatch

- **Pipeline hook stages** — Added `pre-llm` and `post-llm` stages to the pipeline system, enabling
  hooks to run immediately before and after every LLM call within the agent loop

### Fixed

- **Release artifact binary naming** — Compiled binaries inside platform-specific tarballs were
  named `cortex-x86_64-linux` (etc.), but the installer expected `cortex`. The `cortex update`
  command failed with "Extracted binary not found" for all binary installs. Fixed by compiling with
  `--output cortex` and keeping platform names only on the archive filename.

- **Source-mode tarball extraction** — When `git checkout` fails during a source-mode update, the
  GitHub tarball fallback extracted files into a nested subdirectory (`cortex-0.26.0/`) instead of
  the install root. Health checks compared the wrong VERSION file and falsely reported failure.
  Fixed by passing `--strip-components=1` to `tar` for source tarball fallbacks.

- **Source-mode rollback** — Rollback for source installs was a stub that always returned "must be
  done manually via git". Additionally, the rollback guard required `prevBinaryPath` (always empty
  for source mode), blocking all source rollbacks. Implemented full source rollback via
  `git checkout v${prevVersion}` with fetch, checkout, manifest update, and health check.

- **Install script fixes** (`docs/design/install.sh`) — The one-line installer failed in three ways:
  (1) `deno task setup` referenced a non-existent task (changed to
  `deno run --allow-all
  src/db/migrate.ts`); (2) the `cortex` command was never created on PATH
  after install — added a wrapper script at `~/.deno/bin/cortex`; (3) the quick-start instructions
  required manually `cd`-ing to the install directory instead of using the `cortex` command
  directly.

- **Setup wizard non-TTY guard** — Running `cortex setup` without a terminal (e.g., from a piped
  installer) caused the Cliffy prompt to hang or show the web onboarding prompt unexpectedly. Added
  an early return when `Deno.stdin.isTerminal()` is false, running only migrations and printing a
  hint.

- **Welcome screen hang** — The "Press Enter to begin" prompt used raw stdin mode with a buggy
  listener that passed the byte count `n` to `new Uint8Array(n)` instead of the actual buffer data.
  Enter keypresses were never detected, causing an indefinite hang. Fixed by using cooked-mode
  `Deno.stdin.read(buf)` directly.

- **Welcome screen rendering artifacts** — The previous Unicode block-letter ASCII logo used
  `\r`-based typewriter animation that garbled rendering on many terminals, displaying partial text
  like "CORT" instead of "CORTEX". Replaced with a simpler block-character banner (▄█░▀) in the
  style of OpenClaw, printed line-by-line without carriage-return tricks.

- **Health check path construction** — `healthCheckSource()` built file paths with string
  concatenation (`${installPath}/VERSION`) instead of `join()`, producing double-slash paths. Fixed
  by using `join()` from `@std/path`.

---

## [0.26.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Quartermaster — Tool Orchestration Learning System** (`src/quartermaster/`) — A background
  subsystem that learns when and how to select tools by observing the agent's reasoning trajectory.
  Registered as a pipeline hook (`@cortex/quartermaster`, priority 6) at both `pre-tool` and
  `post-tool` stages. Key components:
  - **5-signal prediction engine** — trajectory history, episodic memory hits, tool success
    statistics, task context (metacog), and reflection confidence are fused via weighted combination
    to predict the next tool before the LLM decides
  - **Three-mode decision system** — predictions above 0.9 confidence for safe read-only tools use
    `automate` mode; above 0.6 use `suggest` (hint injected to LLM); otherwise `defer` to LLM
  - **Adaptive learning** — signal weights update via EMA (`new = old + lr × (reward - old)`) with
    decaying learning rate, driven by reflection feedback on prediction accuracy
  - **Observation-first startup** — Quartermaster starts in observe-only mode (always DEFER) until
    50 tool calls are observed, then activates
  - **Context fingerprinting** — 12-feature vector (tool round, file count, error context,
    metacog-derived flags, session age) for pattern matching without query text dependency
  - **SQLite schema** (`018_quartermaster.sql`) — 5 tables: `qm_patterns`, `qm_signal_weights`,
    `qm_tool_stats`, `qm_decisions`, `qm_session_state` with full audit trail per decision
  - **CLI commands** (`cortex qm`) — `patterns`, `weights`, `stats`, `decisions`, `trace <turn>`,
    `dashboard` (ASCII visualization with accuracy bars and trends), `accuracy`, `reset`,
    `reset-all`
  - **REST API** — `GET /api/qm/summary`, `/api/qm/accuracy`, `/api/qm/recent`, `/api/qm/weights`,
    `/api/qm/stats`, `/api/qm/health` exposing live monitoring data
  - **Prometheus metrics** — 7 new metrics (`cortex_qm_predictions_total`,
    `cortex_qm_predictions_correct`, `cortex_qm_observations_total`, `cortex_qm_accuracy`,
    `cortex_qm_weights`, `cortex_qm_patterns_total`, `cortex_qm_confidence`) registered in
    `/metrics` endpoint
  - **Lens audit events** — 5 new event types (`qm_prediction`, `qm_decision_evaluated`,
    `qm_weight_updated`, `qm_pattern_learned`, `qm_mode_changed`) logged for session replay and
    observability
  - **Tool output parsing robustness** — New `extractBareToolCalls()` fallback parser handles LLM
    outputs missing `<tool_call>` wrapper tags by extracting bare JSON `{"tool": ..., "args": ...}`
    objects, improving tool call reliability across all providers

- **Proper skill steps** — All 12 builtin skills now define 5 concrete, actionable steps instead of
  storing the full markdown content as a single step. Each step has `action` (what to do) and
  `description` (how to do it). Steps are displayed in the skill designer UI and available to agents
  via the steps API.

### Changed

- **BuiltinSkill interface** — Added optional `steps?: SkillStep[]` field. Skills can now define
  ordered procedures. `registerBuiltinSkills()` uses defined steps or falls back to single-step
  format for backward compatibility.

### Fixed

- **Skill designer UI null reference errors** — Added existence checks before calling
  `addEventListener()` on DOM elements. Skill designer HTML is now verified to exist before
  JavaScript tries to attach listeners, preventing "Cannot read properties of null" errors.
- **Skill designer metadata field restoration** — Restored original metadata fields (`sd-name`,
  `sd-desc`, `sd-trigger`, `sd-frontmatter-preview`) alongside new metadata fields. Fixed "Cannot
  set properties of null" error when editing skills.
- **Steps tab display** — Steps now render as individual cards instead of a single massive block
  containing the full markdown content.

---

## [0.25.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Model configuration CLI** (`src/cli/models-cmd.ts`) — `cortex models` command with four
  subcommands:
  - `list` — display all configured providers with model, reasoning effort, context window,
    temperature, and max tokens
  - `show <provider>` — detailed view of a single provider's settings including API key status and
    base URL
  - `set <provider> <key> [value]` — set model, reasoningEffort (low/medium/high), contextWindow
    (tokens), temperature, maxTokens, or topP. Omitting the value unsets the field
  - `available [provider]` — fetch available models from a provider's API with the currently
    configured model marked

- **Reasoning effort / extended thinking** — new `reasoningEffort` field on `ProviderConfig` and
  `CompletionOptions`, mapped to provider-specific APIs:
  - **Anthropic** (`src/llm/anthropic.ts`) — `thinking.budget_tokens` with budget tiers: low=1024,
    medium=4096, high=16384
  - **Google** (`src/llm/google.ts`) — `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget` with same tier mapping
  - **OpenAI** (`src/llm/openai.ts`) — `reasoning_effort` parameter (o-series models)
  - **OpenAI-compatible** (`src/llm/openai-compatible.ts`) — `reasoning_effort` parameter (DeepSeek
    R1, Grok-3, etc.)

- **Context window display** — new `contextWindow` field on `ProviderConfig` (informational, shown
  in `models list` and `models show`, not enforced at API level)

- **Built-in skills system** (`src/skills/builtin/`, `src/memory/skills.ts`) — Skills now ship with
  the application as embedded TypeScript modules. `registerBuiltinSkills()` auto-loads built-in
  skills (`cortex-dev`, `frontend-design`) and filesystem skills from `.cortex/skills/` into the
  database at startup. Skills are injected into the system prompt at session start as an
  `<available_skills>` XML block, rather than only appearing reactively per-turn. CLI chat and
  server both call `registerBuiltinSkills()` on startup.

- **Skill designer** (`src/server/ui.ts`) — Full-screen split-pane skill editor replacing the basic
  modal. Three tabbed panels: Content (Markdown editor with live preview), Metadata (name,
  description, trigger pattern with YAML frontmatter preview), and Steps (visual step editor with
  add/remove/reorder, tool + params fields). Draggable resize between editor and live markdown
  preview panels. Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+S` save, `Esc` close. Export to
  `.cortex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` via user-requested endpoint.

- **`skill_write` tool** (`src/tools/builtin/skill_write.ts`) — Agent tool to create, update, or
  delete skills programmatically. Supports name, description, content, trigger_pattern, and ordered
  steps with tool/params. Registered in CLI (`src/cli/chat.ts`) and WebSocket (`src/server/ws.ts`).

- **`skill_read` tool** (`src/tools/builtin/skill_read.ts`) — Agent tool to inspect specific skills
  by name or list all skills with origin filtering. Registered in CLI and WebSocket.

- **`POST /api/skills/export`** (`src/server/router.ts`) — Exports a skill to
  `.cortex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter.

### Changed

- Reasoning effort threads through the entire stack: `AgentTurnOptions`, `AutofixOptions`,
  `reflectOnTurn`, `consolidateReflections`, and all 8+ callers (chat, TUI, WebSocket, sub-agents,
  services, Discord, run, eval) read `reasoningEffort` from the provider config and pass it to LLM
  calls

- `loadHumanSkills()` now scans `.cortex/skills/` for SKILL.md files. `.kilo/` path references
  removed — `.kilo/` is reserved for the Kilo IDE.

### Fixed

- Skills directory path: `.kilo/skills/` references removed from the Cortex skills system. All skill
  loading and export now use `.cortex/skills/`.

---

## [0.24.1] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Agent panel (right sidebar)** (`src/server/ui.ts`, `src/db/sessions.ts`, `src/server/router.ts`)
  — Expandable right sidebar in the chat panel showing agent and sub-agent sessions with status
  dots, channel type badges, turn counts, and last-activity times. Sub-agents are nested under their
  parent sessions with expand/collapse toggles. Hover action buttons for close, archive, delete, and
  resume. Clicking a session switches the chat to that session's full message history. New
  `GET /api/sessions/tree` endpoint returns parent sessions with nested children in a single batch
  query. New `POST /api/sessions/:id/close` and `POST /api/sessions/:id/archive` endpoints for
  session lifecycle management. Archived sessions excluded from the tree view.

- **Structured tool errors** (`src/tools/types.ts`, `src/tools/executor.ts`) — `ToolErrorInfo` with
  `code`, `message`, `retryable`, `suggestedAction`, and `context` fields. All tool failures now
  carry machine-readable error metadata. `formatToolResults` renders error codes and suggested
  actions in tool result XML. Outputs over 8,000 characters are truncated at the presentation layer
  only — full output preserved in the `ToolCallResult` object with `truncated` and `outputLength`
  metadata.

- **Context compaction middleware** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`) — `@cortex/summarization` hook fires
  at 80K estimated token threshold (priority 8 at `pre-reason` stage), summarizes older half of
  conversation history into a compacted block, retaining recent messages intact. PII redaction
  applied to summarized content before injection.

- **Tool output sandboxing** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`) — `@cortex/tool-output-sandbox` hook
  intercepts large tool outputs at `post-tool` stage, stores full output in session-scoped storage
  for retrieval.

- **Build-Verify-Fix enforcement** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`) — `@cortex/pre-completion-checklist`
  injects a self-check system message when the agent emits exit keywords, forcing verification
  before claiming completion.

- **Loop detection** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`) — `@cortex/loop-detection` trackes per-file edit
  counts and injects warnings after 5+ edits to the same file in one turn.

- **Lazy three-tier skill loading** (`src/memory/skills.ts`, `src/tools/builtin/load_skill.ts`) —
  Skills now injected as a compact manifest (name + description + trigger) in the system prompt.
  Full skill instructions loaded on demand via the new `load_skill` tool. `formatSkillDetail()` for
  comprehensive skill display.

- **Eval infrastructure** (`src/eval/` — `types.ts`, `scorer.ts`, `runner.ts`,
  `src/cli/eval-cmd.ts`) — `cortex eval` CLI command with benchmark suite runner, pattern-based
  scoring (regex/contains/not_contains), file content verification, regression detection against
  baseline results, per-category pass/fail statistics, and `--save-baseline` / `--baseline` options.

- **Sandbox gVisor support** (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`, `src/sandbox/agent-sandbox.ts`) — `gvisor`
  added as a `SandboxRuntime` option using `--runtime=runsc` for kernel-level syscall filtering.
  `getAvailableRuntime()` auto-detects gVisor availability and prefers it over plain Docker.
  Supervisor pattern implemented in `agent-sandbox.ts` for running agent execution isolated from the
  control plane.

- **Tool registry enhancement** (`src/tools/registry.ts`) — `toolNames()` method returning all
  registered tool names for error suggestions.

### Changed

- **Validator fail-closed** (`src/tools/executor.ts`) — When the validator daemon is unreachable,
  tool calls are now denied with `POLICY_DENIED` error instead of silently auto-approved. Structured
  error info provides retry guidance.

- **Pipeline hook result handling** (`src/pipeline/manager.ts`) — `injectMessages` from hooks now
  spliced into the message context. `store` side effects now persisted to session-scoped storage
  with accessor and cleanup functions. `modifyInput` now applies at any pipeline stage (not just
  pre-assess).

- **Session state cleanup** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`, `src/agent/loop.ts`) — Per-session state
  (`summarizationStates`, `loopStates` Maps) cleaned up at turn end to prevent unbounded memory
  growth.

- **Pre-completion checklist as system message** (`src/pipeline/builtin.ts`) — Changed from
  appending to LLM response to injecting a system message, so the LLM actually evaluates the
  self-check before the next reasoning round.

### Fixed

- **gVisor detection double-read** (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`) — Fixed `isGVisorAvailable()` calling
  `proc.output()` twice (second call returning empty data), which silently disabled gVisor
  sandboxing.

- **Eval runner memory DB pollution** (`src/cli/eval-cmd.ts`) — Changed from `getMemoryDb()` to
  isolated `initSessionDb()` to prevent eval transcripts from polluting the persistent memory store.

- **Duplicate availability functions** (`src/sandbox/executor.ts`, `src/sandbox/agent-sandbox.ts`) —
  Consolidated `isGVisorAvailable()` and `isDockerAvailable()` into `executor.ts`, re-exported from
  `agent-sandbox.ts`.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Web UI authentication** — PBKDF2 password hashing (200K iterations, SHA-256), session management
  with 7-day cookie expiry, login page (`/login`), onboarding page (`/onboarding`), and
  `POST /api/auth/login` / `POST /api/auth/logout` / `POST /api/auth/setup-password` /
  `POST /api/auth/change-password` endpoints. Password complexity enforcement (8+ chars, 2 of 4
  character classes).
- **WebSocket authentication** — `/ws` endpoint now checks session cookies before upgrading
  connections; returns 401 when `requireAuth` is enabled and no valid session exists. Public
  endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/status`, `/api/system`) bypass auth.
- **`requireAuth` middleware** (`src/server/auth.ts`): `requireAuth()` function for REST endpoints;
  `hasPassword()`, `verifyPassword()`, `setupPassword()`, `changePassword()`, session CRUD
  (`createSession`/`validateSession`/`destroySession`/`getActiveSessions`), cookie parsing and
  `Set-Cookie` header generation.
- **Onboarding CLI** (`src/cli/onboarding/`): 6-step animated setup flow with password creation, LLM
  provider selection (9 providers), AI personalization chat, agent personality picker
  (professional/friendly/developer), telemetry opt-in, and completion screen. Terminal animations,
  logo rendering, background effects, and personalization profile saving.
- **Onboarding REST API** — `POST /api/onboarding/provider` (test + save provider config),
  `POST /api/onboarding/profile/answer` (interactive personalization Q&A),
  `POST /api/onboarding/profile/skip` (skip personalization), `POST /api/onboarding/personality`
  (set agent personality), `POST /api/onboarding/telemetry` (opt in/out),
  `POST /api/onboarding/complete` (finalize setup), `GET /api/onboarding/status` (check current
  state).
- **Node Dispatch tool** (`src/tools/builtin/node_dispatch.ts`): Delegates work to distributed
  Cortex Nodes for remote execution. Supports `action="list"` (discovery),
  `action="shell"`/`"file_read"`/`"file_write"`/`"code_exec"`/`"web_search"` with node selection by
  `node_id`, `tier`, `group`, or `capability` filters. Integrated into agent loop, sub-agents,
  service processes, and WebSocket sessions.
- **Session routing** (`src/hub/session-routing.ts`): Routes node results back to originating
  sessions via `registerPending` / `routeResult` / `onNodeResult` pub/sub. Lens audit events logged
  for every routed result.
- **Node context** (`src/agent/node-context.ts`): Builds a structured "Distributed Nodes" section
  for agent system prompts showing connected nodes, their capabilities, tiers, and groups. Injects
  `node_dispatch` usage instructions into the agent context.
- **Plugin developer documentation** — Three new docs:
  - `docs/plugins/best-practices.md` — single responsibility, error handling, input validation,
    timeout/cancellation, minimal permissions, per-kind guidance (ESM/MCP/WASM), testing, debugging,
    and anti-patterns.
  - `docs/plugins/publishing.md` — marketplace account setup, web UI and API submission, review
    process, version management, marketplace API reference, and publishing best practices.
  - `docs/plugins/submission-standards.md` — repository structure, semantic versioning rules,
    pre-release versioning, AI disclosure requirements (`AI.md` + `aiDisclosure` manifest field),
    breaking change checklist, dependency versioning, pre-submission checklist
    (repository/code/versioning/documentation/legal), step-by-step submission guide, CI/CD with
    GitHub Actions, marketplace review standards, and resubmission guidance.
- **Plugin docs expansion** — `getting-started.md`: trust levels, plugin statuses table, web UI
  plugin management, setting field types reference, REST API table. `developing.md`: full lifecycle
  hook reference (6 hooks + `onConfigChange`), lifecycle sequence diagram, PluginContext API (state
  store, config store, logger, host API), enum params example. `manifest-reference.md`: plugin kinds
  (ESM/MCP/WASM) with protocol details, expanded capability descriptions, full `PluginModule`
  exports table, lifecycle hooks table, `PluginContext` API with type signatures, `Tool` /
  `ToolDefinition` / `ToolParam` / `ToolCallResult` / `ToolContext` interfaces. `README.md`:
  architecture diagram, plugin store structure, trust levels table, documentation index.
- **Plugin extension points** — `onInstall`, `onActivate`, `onDeactivate`, `onUninstall` lifecycle
  hooks; `state.delete()` and `state.list()` on `PluginStateStore`; MCP tool creation via manifest
  `tools` declarations; middleware (`pre`/`post`) and event listener capabilities documented and
  implemented.

### Changed

- **Codebase formatting pass** — Widespread `deno fmt` pass across 65+ source files for consistent
  line wrapping, import ordering, and bracket style per project config (100-char line width, 2-space
  indent, single quotes, semicolons).
- **Plugin CLI enhancements** — `cortex plugins verify`, `cortex plugins permissions`,
  `cortex plugins update --all`, `cortex plugins permissions --trust` subcommands added. Install
  from URL supported.
- **Settings page** — Web auth section added to Security tab.

---

## [0.23.1] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Settings page overhaul** — Tabbed navigation with 7 organized sections (General, Providers &
  Models, Model Router, Updates, User Profile, UI & Appearance, Security). All configuration fields
  from `CortexConfig` are now exposed in the web UI, including previously hidden settings: update
  channels, auto-update, user profile personalization, UI animations/background effects/color
  schemes, and web authentication controls.
- **Password change API** — New `POST /api/auth/change-password` endpoint for changing the web UI
  password from the settings page. Requires current password verification.
- **Plugin validation command** — `cortex plugins validate [--fix]` scans installed plugins for
  invalid entry points and optionally removes them.

### Fixed

- **Plugin initialization order** — Plugins now load after database migrations instead of during CLI
  parsing, preventing errors when the plugins table doesn't exist yet or contains invalid entries.
  Plugin load failures are now non-fatal with summary reporting.
- **Plugin entry point validation** — Invalid entry points (relative paths, bare filenames) are
  rejected with clear error messages before attempting to load.
- **Daemon mode (`cortex serve -d`)** — Fixed spawn to include `--config` and `cwd`, resolving
  import map errors that caused silent daemon startup failures.
- **Daemon restart (`-r` flag)** — Fixed process detection to correctly find and stop existing
  server instances before restarting.
- **Public status endpoints** — `/api/health`, `/api/status`, and `/api/system` now accessible
  without authentication, ensuring the frontend sidebar and status page show correct daemon states
  instead of silently falling back to "off".
- **Status page crash** — Added null guards for `disk` and `memory` fields in the system status page
  to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors.

---

## [0.23.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Distributed agent architecture** — Cortex Hub coordinates remote Cortex Nodes over secure
  WebSocket connections, replacing SSH-based remote control with a structured protocol:
  - **Node Registry** (`src/hub/node-registry.ts`): DB-backed CRUD for Node records with
    vault-stored capability tokens. Nodes table (migration 015) tracks identity, tier, status,
    heartbeat, group, and directive history.
  - **Secure Node WebSocket endpoint** (`src/hub/ws-node.ts`): `/ws/node` handler on the Hub with
    token-based registration, heartbeat/ACK protocol with metrics payload (CPU%, memory, disk),
    3-missed-ACK disconnect detection, streaming output via `stream_chunk`, directive cancel
    support, config push, and token rotation (`rekey`).
  - **Node event system**: `onNodeEvent()` / `emitNodeEvent()` fire `node.connected`,
    `node.disconnected`, and `node.error` events for plugin/pipeline integration.
  - **Message protocol** (`src/remote/types.ts`): Extended `NodeMessage` type with 14 message types
    including `stream_chunk`, `heartbeat_ack`, `cancel`, `config_update`, `rekey`, `NodeMetrics`
    interface, and backward-compatible `RemoteMessage` alias.
- **Capability tiers** (`src/hub/capability-tiers.ts`): Three deployment profiles constraining Node
  privileges — `root` (all tools/paths/commands), `sudo` (scoped commands via sudoers patterns,
  restricted paths), `unprivileged` (read-only + home-directory writes, no shell execution).
  Tier-aware policy enforcement at the Hub before dispatch and local defense-in-depth on the Node.
- **Enhanced Node agent** (`src/remote/agent.ts`): Streaming output for long-running directives,
  local tier policy checks before execution, directive timeout enforcement (default 5 min) via
  `AbortController`, exponential backoff reconnection (1s → 30s cap), heartbeat ACK tracking, system
  metrics collection from `/proc` and `df`, cancel/config_update/rekey directive handling.
  `runNodeAgent()` replaces `runRemoteAgent()` with backward-compatible wrapper.
- **Tier-directed validation** (`src/security/validator.ts`): `validateNodeDirective()` enforces a
  4-layer defense model — tier tool allow-list, tier command restrictions, tier path restrictions,
  and cross-cutting policy rules with per-node filtering.
- **Per-node policy profiles**: Migration 016 adds `node_id` column to `policy_rules` enabling
  node-specific policy overrides. `checkPolicy()` and `addPolicy()` accept optional `nodeId`
  parameter.
- **CLI — `cortex node`** (`src/cli/node.ts`): 6 subcommands: `register` (generates token, stores in
  vault), `list`, `show`, `deregister`, `rekey` (token rotation), `connect` (run as a Node with
  configurable tier/endpoint/timeouts).
- **REST API — Node endpoints**: `POST /api/nodes` (register), `GET /api/nodes` (list with
  tier/status/group filters), `GET /api/nodes/:id`, `DELETE /api/nodes/:id` (deregister),
  `POST /api/nodes/:id/rekey`, `GET /api/nodes/:id/metrics`, `GET /api/nodes/:id/directives`,
  `GET /api/nodes/groups`.
- **Web UI — Nodes page**: Real-time node monitoring dashboard with summary stat cards, tier/status/
  group filter bar, per-node cards with expandable metrics (recent heartbeats: CPU%, memory, disk,
  active directives, uptime) and directive history tables. 10-second auto-refresh.
- **Prometheus metrics for nodes**: 5 new metric families —
  `cortex_node_directives_dispatched_total`, `cortex_node_directives_completed_total`,
  `cortex_node_directives_failed_total`, `cortex_node_connections`,
  `cortex_node_heartbeat_age_seconds`.
- **Systemd unit template** — `deploy/cortex-node@.service` for running Cortex Nodes as systemd
  services with environment variable configuration (`CORTEX_NODE_TOKEN`, `CORTEX_HUB_ENDPOINT`,
  `CORTEX_NODE_TIER`).

### Changed

- `src/server/server.ts` now routes `/ws/node` to the new Node WebSocket handler alongside the
  existing `/ws` UI WebSocket handler.
- `src/db/lens.ts` `EventType` union expanded with 7 node event types: `node_connected`,
  `node_disconnected`, `node_heartbeat`, `node_directive`, `node_directive_dispatched`,
  `node_stream_chunk`.
- `RemoteAgentInfo`, `RemoteDirective`, `RemoteResult` types in `src/remote/types.ts` extended with
  `stream`, `timeoutMs`, `NodeMetrics`, `StreamChunk` fields; `RemoteMessage` renamed to
  `NodeMessage` with backward-compatible alias.
- `dispatchDirective()` in ws-node.ts returns `DispatchResult` (`{dispatched, reason}`) instead of
  boolean, with policy validation before dispatch.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Unified skills model** — skills now track `origin` (`human` | `llm`) and support full Markdown
  `content` storage. Human-authored skills provide domain knowledge and conventions; LLM-extracted
  skills capture emerging patterns from agent tool sequences.
- **Human-authored skill loading** — skills can be loaded from `.cortex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `trigger_pattern`). API endpoint
  `POST /api/skills/load-human` and "Load .cortex/skills" button in the Web UI.
- **Skill CRUD API** — new endpoints for creating (`POST /api/skills`), reading
  (`GET /api/skills/detail?name=`), and deleting (`DELETE /api/skills?name=`) skills.
  `GET /api/skills` now supports `?origin=human|llm` filtering.
- **Skill stats endpoint** — `GET /api/skills/stats` returns total/human/llm counts and average
  success rate.
- **Skill injection into agent context** — `findMatchingSkills()` and `formatSkillsForPrompt()` now
  inject relevant skills into the agent's system prompt before each reasoning turn. Skills with
  `origin='human'` are always eligible; learned skills require `success_rate >= 0.3` to avoid
  steering the agent toward unproven patterns.
- **Skill extraction from agent turns** — `extractSkillFromSession()` runs as a fire-and-forget
  background LLM call whenever 2+ tool calls are made in a turn, analyzing tool sequences to extract
  reusable skill patterns. Tool parameters are redacted for sensitive keys (`api_key`, `token`,
  `password`, etc.) before being sent to the extraction LLM.
- **Redesigned skills Web UI** — filter tabs (All / Human / Learned), stats summary bar,
  click-to-expand skill detail with full content and step listing, and a full modal form for
  creating/editing human-authored skills with name, description, trigger pattern, and Markdown
  content fields. Edit buttons on human-authored skill cards load data into the modal pre-filled.
- **Migration 014** — adds `origin` and `content` columns to the `procedural_memory` table in
  `memory.db`.

### Changed

- `storeSkill()` UPDATE now handles `origin` and `content` columns, uses conditional version bumping
  (only increments when steps/description/content actually change), and properly preserves `origin`
  on upsert so human-authored skills don't revert to `'llm'`.
- `listSkills()` supports optional `origin` parameter for filtering.
- Removed orphaned `maybeExtractSkill()` function (replaced by direct `extractSkillFromSession`
  calls in the agent loop).

### Fixed

- Unescaped single quotes in CSS `font-family` values inside JavaScript string literals caused
  browser syntax errors on the skills page. Fixed by removing unnecessary font quotes and using
  proper `\\'` escaping in onclick handlers per existing codebase patterns.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Memory heuristic learning** — AI-driven memory self-improvement that runs daily
  - Access tracking: records every retrieval to `access_count` and `last_accessed`, enabling
    usage-based reinforcement
  - Importance boosting: heavily-accessed memories (10+ hits) get +0.15 importance bump, moderate
    (5+) get +0.05, with `access_count` reset after each boost cycle
  - Decay slowing: frequently-accessed memories receive a one-time 1.3× half-life extension
    (episodic 14→18.2 days, semantic 30→39 days), capped at 90/180 days respectively
  - Co-occurrence learning: analyzes entity pairs across episodic memories, creates or strengthens
    `related_to` graph relations when entities co-occur 3+ times
  - Auto-categorization: 12 pattern-based rules auto-tag untagged semantic memories with categories
    (api, database, frontend, debugging, security, devops, etc.) and tags
  - Memory health dashboard: aggregated metrics for active/stale counts, average decay, importance,
    access frequency, graph entity/relation counts, and reflection confidence
  - All heuristic jobs run via `runHeuristicCycle()` in the daily consolidation cycle
- **Richer memory search** — search results now include entities, topics, tags, category, decay
  score with visual bar, and access count
- **Memory page tabs** — rebuilt Web UI with Search, Graph, Reflections, and Health tabs
  - Graph tab: entity browser with type badges, click-through traversal showing grouped relations
    with strength bars, and breadcrumb navigation
  - Reflections tab: confidence-ranked pattern list with category badges and confidence bars
  - Health tab: per-tier cards with total/active/stale counts, decay distribution bars, average
    metrics, and graph/reflection overview
- **New API endpoints** — `GET /api/memory/health`, `GET /api/memory/reflections`,
  `GET /api/memory/graph/entities?q=`, `GET /api/memory/graph?entity=&depth=`
- **Centralized version module** — extracted `getVersion()` into `src/config/version.ts`, reused by
  main entrypoint, status API, and update installer

### Fixed

- Heuristic learning column mismatches: `last_accessed_at` removed from episodic (column didn't
  exist), fixed to `last_accessed` on semantic, `context` replaced with `metadata` (JSON) on
  graph_relations INSERT
- `slowDecayForFrequentAccess` now guarded against daily compounding (only applies when
  `half_life_days` is at default)
- `boostImportanceFromAccess` now resets `access_count` after each boost to prevent qualifying set
  from growing unbounded
- Escaped single quotes in `esc()` to prevent XSS via entity names in onclick handlers
- Replaced dynamic `import('./heuristics.ts')` with static import in `retrieve()` hot path
- `getMemoryHealth()` now uses 60s in-memory cache to avoid full table scans per request
- Removed duplicate `ageStr()` function in favor of existing `timeAgo()` for consistent relative
  time formatting
- **Pipeline hooks system** (`src/pipeline/`): 10-stage middleware architecture (pre/post-assess,
  pre/post-reason, pre/post-tool, pre/post-reflect, pre/post-output). Priority-ordered hook
  execution within each stage with abort support. Built-in hooks: content safety filter
  (`@cortex/content-safety`), prompt injection detector (`@cortex/injection-guard`), cost tracker
  (`@cortex/cost-tracker`), audit logger (`@cortex/audit-log`). Sync hooks block the pipeline; async
  hooks fire-and-forget. Timeout enforcement per hook (5s sync, 15s async). CLI: `cortex hooks`
  (list/init/disable). API: `GET /api/hooks`, `POST /api/hooks/:name/disable`.
- **Enhanced onboarding wizard** (`src/cli/setup.ts`): 4-step first-run wizard (model provider →
  personality → channels → telemetry). Personality templates generate SOUL.md
  (professional/friendly/developer/custom). Channel selection (CLI only / CLI+Web / CLI+Discord /
  all). Connection test validates API key before saving. Post-install summary with next-step
  commands.
- **Event triggers system** (`src/triggers/`): Webhook receiver with HMAC signature verification
  (GitHub, GitLab, generic providers). Filesystem watcher using `Deno.watchFs` with configurable
  debounce and pattern matching. Git hook installer auto-places `post-receive`/`post-commit`
  scripts. Rate limiting with sliding windows and cooldown periods. IP allowlisting for webhook
  endpoints. Jinja2-style prompt template rendering. Trigger-to-job mapping creates immediate agent
  turns. CLI: `cortex triggers` (list/add/remove/install-hooks/uninstall-hooks). API:
  `POST /api/webhooks/:name`.
- **Observability** (`src/observability/`): Prometheus-compatible metrics (counter, gauge,
  histogram) with labels. 15 pre-registered metric families: agent turns/tokens/cost/errors,
  validator intents approved/rejected, executor actions/duration, scheduler jobs, memory
  consolidations, system CPU/memory/uptime. Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint on port 3000.
  OpenTelemetry-compatible trace spans with OTLP export support. `registerMetric()`, `counterInc()`,
  `gaugeSet()`, `histogramObserve()` API.
- **Channel plugin API** (`src/channels/`): `ChannelPlugin` interface with
  connect/disconnect/onEvent/send/edit/react/delete/typing/upload. Canonical types for
  cross-platform events, targets, users, attachments, rich embeds. Channel manager handles
  registration, start/stop lifecycle, and agent binding. Event handler routing from platform events
  to agent turns. CLI: `cortex channels` (list/start/stop).
- **MCP server** (`src/mcp/server.ts`): Cortex operates as a Model Context Protocol server. JSON-RPC
  2.0 protocol support (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `resources/list`, `prompts/list`).
  Dual transport: stdio mode (for Claude Desktop, VS Code) and HTTP mode (GET/POST `/mcp`). All
  Cortex tools exposed as `cortex.*` namespaced MCP tools. Built-in MCP tools:
  `cortex.search_memory`, `cortex.list_sessions`, `cortex.health`. CLI: `cortex mcp` (serve/stdio).
- **Remote agent protocol** (`src/remote/`): Headless remote agents connect via WebSocket to a
  Cortex primary. Primary handles reasoning/memory/credentials; remote handles local
  filesystem/tools/execution. Registration flow with token authentication. Heartbeat-based health
  monitoring with automatic reconnection. Directive/result message protocol. Remote agent manager
  tracks connected agents and routes delegation. CLI: `cortex remote` (add/connect/remove).
- **Terminal UI** (`src/tui/terminal.ts`): Full-screen interactive terminal interface with
  split-pane layout (70/30 chat/tools). Raw terminal input handling with ANSI escape codes.
  Scrollable message pane with user/assistant messages. Tool call status panel showing
  running/success/error with durations. Input line with command history (up/down navigation). Key
  bindings: Ctrl+C cancel, Ctrl+L clear, Up/Down history, Enter send. Status bar showing agent
  state, message count, token usage. CLI: `cortex tui`.
- **Workflow engine** (`src/workflow/engine.ts`): Deterministic workflow DSL with `.step()`,
  `.branch()`/`.if()`, `.parallel()`, `.goto()`, `.waitForApproval()`. DAG execution with context
  passthrough between steps. Parallel step execution with `Promise.all` error isolation.
  Human-in-the-loop approval via `workflow.approve()`. Built-in `health-check` workflow. CLI:
  `cortex workflow` (list/run/approve).
- **Project workspaces** (`src/projects/manager.ts`): Per-project isolated directories under
  `~/.cortex/data/projects/`. Project config stores agent binding, tool allow-lists, and
  description. Auto-initialized directory structure. CLI: `cortex projects` (list/create/delete).
- **Plugin namespace isolation** (`src/plugins/namespace.ts`): `@author/plugin-name` identity model
  with key-based author verification. Tool names auto-prefixed to `@author/plugin-name/tool`.
  Short-name aliases with `setToolAlias()`/`resolveAlias()`. Collision detection: same author prefix
  → error, different authors → no collision.
- **UI plugin slots** (`src/plugins/ui-slots.ts`): 5 slot types (sidebar, panel, modal,
  timeline-item, widget). Web component-based plugin registration with HTML/JS URL serving.
  Slot-specific HTML generation for dashboard injection. Message bus API with permission-limited
  commands (navigate, notification, config, query).
- **Desktop automation** (`src/desktop/automation.ts`): 11 desktop actions (screenshot, click,
  dblclick, type, keypress, drag, clipboard get/set, wait, move, scroll). `xdotool`/`scrot`/`xclip`
  wrapper via `Deno.Command`. Docker XFCE+noVNC container template with entrypoint script. CLI:

  filtering, PII redaction (email, IP, SSN, card, API key patterns), and configurable retention
  periods. `enforceMemoryRetention()` for automatic expiry.
- **OpenClaw migration tool** (`src/cli/openclaw-migrate.ts`): Imports SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md,
  AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and memory markdown files from `~/.openclaw/` into Cortex data directory.
  Memory content chunked and imported as session messages. Dry-run mode.

### Changed

- **Agent loop refactored** with pipeline hooks integration at all 10 stages. Built-in hooks
  auto-registered on first turn.
- **Setup wizard** enhanced from single provider selection to full 4-step onboarding with
  personality templates, channel selection, connection testing, and telemetry consent.

- **Sub-agent type system** (`src/agent/sub-agent-types.ts`):
  - Five specialized sub-agent types: `explore` (codebase search, read-only), `general` (full tool
    access, multi-step), `plan` (execution plans, read-only), `code` (file write/edit/shell),
    `research` (web search, read-only)
  - Each type has its own system prompt, tool allow-list, and max turn limit
  - Type selection via `type` parameter on the `sub_agent` tool with enum validation
  - Type overrides flow through: tool → `spawnSubAgent()` → child process → session creation
- **Enhanced sub_agent tool** (`src/tools/builtin/sub_agent.ts`):
  - New `type` parameter with enum (`explore`, `general`, `plan`, `code`, `research`)
  - Comprehensive tool description with guidance on **when** to use sub-agents (parallel work,
    specialization, deep investigation), **when not** to use them, what each type does, and parallel
    usage instructions
  - Type-based configuration automatically sets tool allow-lists and turn limits
- **Intelligent delegation detection** (`src/agent/metacog.ts`):
  - New task signals: `isExploratory`, `isCodeTask`, `isPlanningTask`, `isComplex`
  - `suggestedSubAgents` output field on `MetaAssessment` recommending specific sub-agent types
  - Enhanced detection: complex code+exploration → delegate to explorer, research+independent →
    parallelize with sub-agent types, pure exploration → delegate to explorer, destructive
    multi-step → suggest plan sub-agent
  - Meta-cog guidance now includes concrete sub-agent type recommendations in system prompt
- **Sub-agent guidance in agent soul** (`src/agent/soul.ts`):
  - Default SOUL.md now includes a "Sub-Agents" section with clear usage guidelines
  - Documents all five sub-agent types, when to use each, and when NOT to use sub-agents
- **Session parent-child tracking**:
  - Migration 013 adds `parent_session_id` column and index to `sessions` table
    (`src/db/migrations/013_sessions_parent.sql`)
  - `createSession()` now accepts optional `parentSessionId` parameter
  - Sub-agent entry point persists parent session ID on session creation
  - New DB functions: `getChildSessions()`, `getParentSession()`, `countChildSessions()`
  - `deleteSession()` clears parent references on orphaned children
  - API endpoint `GET /api/sessions/:id/children` returns all sub-agent sessions for a parent
- **Session parent-child visibility**:
  - Web UI session list shows channel type badges (explore, code, web, etc.) color-coded by type and
    `⤷ child` badge for sub-agent sessions
  - Session detail view shows `← parent` link to navigate up to parent session, and lists sub-agents
    as clickable links to navigate down into child sessions
  - CLI `cortex sessions` shows `[channel-type]` badges, `⤷ N sub-agents` for parents, and
    `⤣ child of <id>` for sub-agent sessions

### Changed

- `sub_agent` tool definition rewritten with comprehensive context for the LLM about delegation
  strategy, type selection, and parallel usage patterns
- `SubAgentTask` interface gained `subAgentType` field for type-based specialization
- `spawnSubAgent()` applies type-based overrides (system prompt, tools, max turns) before spawning
- `sub-agent-entry.ts` creates sessions with typed channel labels (`subagent:explore`,
  `subagent:code`, etc.)

- **Plugin system Phase 3 — Web UI extension** (`src/plugins/extensions/ui.ts`, `src/server/ui.ts`):
  - Dynamic plugin panel tabs in the Web UI sidebar under "Plugin Panels" section
  - Plugin panels render in sandboxed iframes with `postMessage` bridge (`window.Cortex` API)
  - `CortexUiApi` provides plugin panels with `fetch`, `getConfig`, `setConfig`, `notify`,
    `onEvent`, `emit`
  - `GET /api/plugins/:name/panel` and `GET /api/plugins/:name/panel.js` routes serve plugin UI
  - Host-side `message` event listener receives plugin notifications as toast messages
  - `GET /api/plugins/panels` returns active plugin panels with metadata
- **Plugin system Phase 4 — Security & WASM**:
  - Permission resolution engine (`resolvePermissions()`) merges declared capabilities with user
    overrides from `plugin_permission_overrides` table
  - `deriveDenoWorkerPermissions()` maps `PluginCapability[]` to `Deno.PermissionOptions` for Worker
    sandboxing
  - SHA-256 integrity verification (`computeSha256()`, `verifyEntryPointIntegrity()`)
  - Worker-based sandbox (`loadSandboxedEsmPlugin()`) with JSON-RPC protocol, 30s init timeout
  - WASM plugin loader (`loadWasmPlugin()`) with host ABI (`log`, `http_request`, `get_config`,
    `set_state`, `get_state`)
  - CLI: `cortex plugins verify <name>` (integrity check),
    `cortex plugins permissions <name> [--set cap=grant|deny]` (permission management)
- **Plugin system Phase 5 — Marketplace integration & updates**:
  - Plugin update checker (`checkPluginUpdate()`, `applyPluginUpdate()`) queries marketplace/source
    for newer versions
  - `cortex plugins update [name] [--all] [--check]` — check and apply plugin updates
  - `cortex marketplace install <slug> [--yes]` — install from marketplace with permission preview
    (highlights sensitive permissions)
  - Semver-aware version comparison and disable-update-re-enable update flow
- **UI bug fix**: Fixed JavaScript parsing error in GitHub PR/Issue rendering (`\'` → `\\'` escaping
  in template literal) that prevented the entire UI script from executing

### Changed

- `plugins-cmd.ts` gained `update`, `verify`, `permissions` subcommands
- `marketplace-cmd.ts` gained `install` subcommand with permission preview
- Plugin list/enable/disable in Web UI uses `name` instead of `id` (matches Phase 1 breaking change)

---

## [0.19.0] — 2026-06-15

- Unified type system with `PluginCapability`, `PluginManifest`, `PluginRow` (aligned with migration
  005 canonical schema)
- `PluginManager` singleton orchestrating full install/enable/disable/remove lifecycle

  routes `/api/plugins/:id` → `/api/plugins/:name`. CLI commands use name instead of id.
- `registry.ts` rewritten to align with migration 005 canonical schema (24 columns)
- `loader.ts` rewritten with PluginContext injection and tool auto-registration
- `chat.ts` and `ws.ts` use `globalRegistry` with automatic plugin tool loading via
  `pluginManager.loadAll()`

  - `cortex update --channel pre` — include pre-release versions
  - `cortex update --rollback` — revert to previous version (24h grace period)
  - `cortex update --status` — show current/latest version and channel
  - `cortex update --force` — bypass dirty working tree check (source mode)

- **Self-contained binary mode** — compiled `deno compile` binary supports `--subprocess` dispatch
  for validator, executor, scheduler, and supervisor, replacing `deno run <entry.ts>` spawning
  - `src/main.ts` detects `--subprocess` flag before CLI parser and dispatches to the correct
    process function
  - Supervisor uses `isCompiledBinary()` heuristic to choose `--subprocess <name>` vs
    `deno run --allow-all main.ts --subprocess <name>` for child process spawning
  - `VERSION` file at repo root — single source of version truth, enforced against `deno.json` in CI

  - Full 7-point registration: config type, default config, router switch, setup wizard, model
    lister, UI dropdowns, and settings metadata
- **Marketplace connection** — new Web UI marketplace page plus CLI commands to install plugins,
  import agents, and discover items from cortexprism.io
  - **Web UI Marketplace page** — dedicated page with tabbed browsing for plugins and agents, search
    bar with debounce, kind/category filters, one-click Install and Import buttons, stats bar
    showing total plugins/agents/downloads, and proxy API endpoints through the Cortex server
  - `cortex plugin install marketplace:<host>/plugins/<slug>` — resolves the marketplace: prefix,
    fetches the plugin manifest from the marketplace API, and installs it
  - `cortex agent import marketplace:<host>/agents/<slug>` — resolves the marketplace: prefix,
    fetches the agent configuration from the marketplace API, and registers it as a local agent
  - `cortex agent import <url>` — fetches an agent configuration from any URL, registers it as a
    local agent
  - `cortex marketplace list plugins` — browse available plugins with search, kind, and category
    filters
  - `cortex marketplace list agents` — browse available agents with search, provider, and category
    filters

  - `cortex marketplace stats` — display marketplace statistics (total plugins, agents, downloads)

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Session resume** — sessions can be reopened and continued across WebSocket reconnects, page
  reloads, and CLI sessions
  - `resumeSession()` / `deleteSession()` DB functions in `src/db/sessions.ts`
  - `POST /api/sessions/:id/resume` endpoint to reopen closed sessions
  - `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` now cleans up per-session DB files and session rows
  - WebSocket resume — existing `sessionId` from client reopens the per-session DB and reactivates
    the session
  - CLI `--resume` / `-s` flag to resume an existing session by ID
  - Web UI "Continue" button on session list items and detail view
  - Session detail view shows `session_messages` instead of raw Lens events
  - `restoreSession()` now reopens the session server-side via the resume API
- **Session persistence in chat UI** — `sessionId` stored in `localStorage`, messages restored from
  session DB on page load
- **Per-agent session filtering** — sessions page scoped by agent ID
- **Token usage analytics** — per-model breakdown with daily token/cost totals
- **Command palette agent/session search** — quick search across agents and sessions
- **Agent workspace/session counts** — displayed in agent cards in the UI

### Fixed

- `createSession` crash on resume — check for existing session before INSERT to avoid primary key
  conflict
- Chat session message query — fixed `/api/sessions/:id/messages` to query `session_messages` table
- `file_rename` logging — missing audit trail entries
- Undo/redo path filter — incorrect path matching that could apply operations to wrong files
- Global workspace undo/redo endpoints — missing route registrations
- `file_change` WebSocket events — broadcast on edits, renames, deletes
- Editor delete button — now fires correctly from the UI

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **10 new LLM providers** (`src/llm/`):
  - **Google Gemini** (`google.ts`) — native SDK integration with streaming and usage metadata

  - Graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown of all children
  - `cortex daemon start` — spawns supervisor in the background
  - `cortex daemon run` — runs supervisor in the foreground (for systemd/tmux)
- **`cortex serve --daemon` / `-d`** — run the HTTP server as a background daemon process
- **Auto-start daemons** — `cortex chat` and `cortex serve` automatically start the daemon
  supervisor if not already running
- **`cortex daemon restart`** — restart all daemon processes (stop + 1s delay + start)
- **`cortex serve --restart` / `-r`** — restart a background server by killing the existing process
  on the same port before starting a new one
- **`cortex stop`** — stop all background processes (HTTP server + daemons) with a single command
  - `--server-only` and `--daemon-only` flags for targeted shutdown
- **`cortex serve --stop` / `-s`** — stop a background HTTP server by port
- **LLM settings redesign** — Add Model modal, model fetching from provider APIs, fine-tuning
  controls (temperature, max tokens, top-p)

  requiring separate secret keys (e.g., AWS Bedrock)
- **`ProviderKind` union** extended to include all 15 supported providers

### Fixed

- `serve -d` verifies the server is actually running before exiting
- `serve --restart` excludes own PID from `pgrep` results
- `serve --restart` preserves original `--host` setting by reading `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`
